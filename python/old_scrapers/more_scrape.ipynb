such as \" clone\" and \" killer\" applied to games either similar to or anticipated to be better than it Its sequel was released for the original Xbox in 2004 and the game spawned a multi-billion-dollar that incorporates games books toys and films The game inspired and was used in the fan-created video series which is credited as one of the first major successes of the technique of using real-time 3D engines often from video games to create animated films More than six million copies had been sold worldwide by November 2005 A was released for Xbox 360 by 343 Industries on the

switches to a during vehicle use for pilots and mounted gun operators; passengers maintain a first-person view The game s includes a \"motion tracker\" that registers moving allies moving or firing enemies and vehicles in a certain radius of the player The player character is equipped with an energy shield that nullifies damage from weapons fire and forceful impacts The shield s charge appears as a blue bar in the corner of the game s heads-up display and it automatically recharges if no damage is sustained for a brief period When the shield is fully depleted the player becomes highly vulnerable and further damage reduces the of their health meter When this health meter reaches zero the character dies and the game reloads from a saved checkpoint Health can be replenished through the collection of health packs scattered around the game s levels s arsenal consists of The game has been praised for giving each weapon a unique purpose thus making each useful in different scenarios For example plasma weapons need time to cool if fired too rapidly but cannot be reloaded and must be discarded upon depletion of their batteries whereas conventional firearms cannot overheat but require reloading and ammunition In contrast to the large weapon inventories of contemporary FPS games players may carry only two weapons at once calling for strategy when managing firearms departs from traditional FPS conventions by not forcing the player character to holster its firearm before deploying or melee-range ; instead both attacks can be utilized while a gun is still equipped supplanting or supplementing small-arms fire Like the game s other weapons the two types of grenades differ; the fragmentation grenade bounces and detonates quickly whereas the plasma grenade adheres to targets before exploding The game s main enemy force is the a group of alien species allied by belief in a common religion Their forces include fierce warriors protected by recharging energy shields similar to the player s own; which are short cowardly creatures who are usually led by Elites in battle and often flee in terror instead of fighting in the absence of a leading Elite; originally space pirates who wear a highly durable energy shield on one arm and a form of handgun on the other; and large powerful creatures composed of small worm-like colonies with thick armor plates that cover the majority of their bodies and a large assault cannon that fires explosive rounds of green plasma A secondary enemy is the a alien life form that appears in several variants Another enemy is the Sentinels aerial robots designed by an extinct race called the to protect their structures and prevent Flood outbreaks Sentinels are able to hover around in enclosed spaces and produce an energy shield when under attack They lack durability but use powerful laser weapons and are immune to infection by the Flood The in has been favorably received The player is often aided by

best multiplayer games of all time Although the Xbox version of lacks official support for online multiplayer play third-party software provide unofficial ways around this limitation The Windows and Macintosh ports of support online matches involving up to 16 players and include multiplayer maps not in the original Xbox release However co-operative play was removed from the ports because it would

travel called slip-space allows the human race to colonize planets other than Earth The planet Reach serves as an interstellar hub of scientific and military activity The UNSC develops a secret program to create augmented supersoldiers known as Spartans More than twenty years before the beginning of the game a technologically advanced collective of alien races called the Covenant begins a religious war against humanity declaring them an affront to their gods Humanity s military experiences a series of crushing defeats; although the Spartans are effective against the Covenant they are too few in number to turn the tide In 2552 Covenant forces attack and destroy the colony The starship escapes the planet with the Spartan on board The ship initiates a jump to slip-space hoping to lead the enemy away from Earth The game begins as the exits slip-space and its crew discovers a large structure of unknown origin The Covenant pursues the and attacks With the ship heavily damaged the

successor to s previous first-person shooter games and According to company co-founder certain of both and the series such as their similar protagonists and representation of artificial intelligence stemmed from a common stylistic After the 1995 release of Bungie began to consider ideas for their subsequent game Undecided about further entries in the series the team was willing to try something new One of the ideas that the team then began to develop was that of a first-person shooter game described by co-founder as \"the natural extension of which would have turned out to be something along the lines of \" Concurrently the team explored the concept of a that featured tank battles in a futuristic setting internally dubbed \"The Giant Bloody War Game\" Jones started the design of a 3D engine that could generate graphics to visualize elevated surfaces and he eventually suggested that Bungie use the technology to realize the \"tank combat\" idea The team was enthusiastic about that prospect and proceeded to cancel their first-person shooter project–to commit to the creation of \"The Giant Bloody War Game\" However Jones struggled to implement a model to simulate vehicles in the game which led Bungie to change their plans and develop the RTS released in 1997 Around this time Bungie comprised around 15 people working in south After was completed and Bungie decided on a sequel Jones delegated its development to the company s other designers and resumed his work on the technology that had not been applied to the 1997 title A group of three Bungie staffers began to develop an RTS with a focus on science fiction realistic physics simulations and three-dimensional terrain Early versions used the and The project had the initial working title but was changed for being \"boring\" and for the project s dramatic changes from what was first envisioned It was switched to then after Jones could not bring himself to tell his mother the original name Experimenting with ways of controlling units Bungie added a mode that attached the camera to individual units The vantage point continually moved closer to the units as the developers realized it would be more fun for players to drive the vehicles themselves rather than have the computer do it \"And controlling [the vehicle] just that double tactile nature of load a dude in get a dude out hands on the steering wheel—it was like this be an RTS game \" recalled Seropian By mid-1998 the game had become a Peter Tamte Bungie s then-executive vice president used his contacts from his former position at to get lead writer and project lead Jason Jones an audience with CEO Jobs impressed agreed to debut the game to the world at the 1999 Anticipation built for the unknown Bungie game after favorable reviews from industry journalists under at 1999 Days before the Macworld announcement still had no permanent title; possible names included and Bungie hired a branding firm that came up with the name but Bungie artist Paul Russell suggested alternatives including Though some did not like the name—likening it to something religious or a women s shampoo—designer Marcus Lehto said \"it described enough about what our intent was for this universe in a way that created this sense of mystery \" On July 21 1999 during the Macworld Conference &amp; Expo Jobs announced that would be released for and simultaneously The game s premise at this point involved a human transport starship that crash-lands on a mysterious ringworld Early versions of the Covenant arrive to loot what they can and war erupts between them and the humans Unable to match the technologically advanced alien race the humans resort to At this point Bungie promised an game with terrain that reacted and deformed from explosions persistent environment details such as spent shell casings and variable weather none of which made it into the final product These early versions featured -specific fauna later dropped following design difficulties and the creatures detraction from the surprise appearance of the Flood The Master Chief was simply known as the cyborg When was shown at it was still a third-person shooter Bungie s financial situation during s development was precarious Ahead of s release Bungie was surviving on sales and had missed release dates A glitch that caused to wipe the contents of the directory it was installed to was only discovered after 200 000 copies had already been produced for the December 1998 launch Bungie recalled the copies and issued a fix costing the company $800 000 As a result Bungie sold a share of the company and publishing rights to Still facing financial difficulties Bungie s Tamte contacted the head of about a possible acquisition Fries was working on developing the software lineup for Microsoft s first game console the Fries negotiated an agreement with Take-Two Interactive wherein Microsoft gained Bungie and the rights to while Take-Two kept the and properties Jones and Seropian pitched the purchase to the rest of Bungie as the way they could shape the future of a new game console Microsoft announced its acquisition of Bungie on June 19 2000 was now to be the tentpole launch game for the Xbox In less than a year Bungie had to turn from a loose collection of gameplay and plot ideas into a shipping product on an unproven console To make players feel more connected to the action Jason Jones pushed to turn the game s perspective from third-person to first-person A key concern was making sure the game played well on the Xbox s ; at the time first-person shooters on consoles were rare Spearheading the effort designer Jaime Griesemer wrote code to discern player intent and assist the player s movement and aiming without being obvious The game buffered player inputs so that the result was the player movement rather than the movement players were actually making Other Bungie projects were scrapped and their teams absorbed into in the rush to complete it Griesemer said that after the Bungie team moved to the in he was so busy he did not unpack his belongings for six months The designers prototyped encounters and enemy AI on a sandbox level \"B30\" The success of gameplay on this small chunk of the game energized the team and B30 became \" \" the fourth mission To make the release date Bungie made drastic cuts to the game s features and scope The open-world plans were scrapped and it became clear the lengthy planned campaign was not feasible One level was cut and replaced with an expositional cutscene Staten described his role as putting \"story duct tape\" over gaps that appeared to smooth them over To save time Lehto suggested reusing campaign levels; glowing directional arrows were added after playtesters got lost backtracking Microsoft game writers Eric Trautmann and Brannon Boren performed last-minute rewrites to the script An online multiplayer component was dropped because would not be ready Only four months before release it was decided that the multiplayer was still not fun so it was scrapped and rebuilt from scratch using team members who moved from the defunct Bungie West team after completing Some personnel took to sleeping in the office for the last few months to make sure the game made its deadline Bungie s social culture—and the rush to complete the game—meant that team members provided input and feedback across disciplines Aspects such as level design demanded collaboration between the designers creating the environments for players to explore and the artists who developed those environments aesthetics Initially artists Robert McLees and Lehto were the only artists working on what would become Bungie hired Shi Kai Wang as an additional artist to refine Lehto s designs The aliens making up the Covenant began with varied exploratory designs that coalesced once each enemy s role in the gameplay was defined Spearheaded by Paul Russell the game s visual design changed in response to the changing gameplay and story The artists made efforts to distinguish each faction in the game by their architecture technology and weaponry The UNSC s original curved look was made blockier to distinguish it from the Covenant; likewise human weapons remained projectile-based to provide a contrast to the Covenant s energy weapons and their vehicles based on animals with the being inspired by Lehto s love of off-roading The interiors of drew significant influence from the production design of the film Organic curvilinear forms along with a color palette of greens and purples were used for the Covenant while the Forerunner came to be defined by their angular constructions; the interiors originally drew on Aztec patterns and the work of before becoming more refined just five months from the game s completion Composer and his company TotalAudio were tasked with creating the music for s MacWorld debut Staten told O Donnell that the music should give a feeling of ancient mystery O Donnell decided would be appropriate and performed the vocals alongside his composing partner and additional singers Because he did not know how long the presentation would be O Donnell created \"smushy\" opening and closing sections that could be expanded or cut as the time required to back up a rhythmic middle section The music was recorded in Chicago and sent to New York for the show the same night the piece was finished Shortly before Bungie was bought by Microsoft O Donnell joined Bungie as a staff member while Salvatori remained at TotalAudio O Donnell designed the music so that it \"could be dissembled and remixed in such a way that would give [him] multiple interchangeable loops that could be randomly recombined in order to keep the piece interesting as well as a variable-length\" Development involved the creation of \"alternative middle sections that could be transitioned to if the game called for such a change i e less or more intense \" O Donnell sat with the level designers to walk through the levels constructing music that would adapt to the gameplay rather than be static; \"The level designer would tell me what he hoped a player would feel at certain points or after accomplishing certain tasks \" Based on this information O Donnell would develop cues the designer could script into the level and then he and the designer would play through the mission to see if the audio worked He made sparse use of music because he believes that \"[music] is best used in a game to quicken the emotional state of the player and it works best when used least \" and that \"[if] music is constantly playing it tends to become sonic wallpaper and loses its impact when it is needed to truly enhance some dramatic component of gameplay \" The cutscenes came so late that O Donnell had to score them in only three days Ed Fries described the period before the Xbox s launch as chaotic; \"You ve got to imagine this environment of panic combined with adrenaline but money s mostly no object at the same time So we were spending lots of it trying to do all this crazy stuff \" he recalled After several planned video game tie-ins to s film were scrapped it became clear that had to serve as the tentpole title for the Xbox a role which the game was never intended to fill s debut had been well-received but its move to the unproven Xbox console caused press treatment to be colder than it was before While a playable demonstration of the game at Gamestock 2001 was well-received critics had mixed reactions to its exhibition at E3 2001 where the game was shown off in a very broken state with poor and technical issues Even within Microsoft was divisive After Bungie refused to change the name to appease marketing research teams the subtitle \"Combat Evolved\" was added to make it more descriptive and compete better with other military-themed games Fries recalled analysts had suggested that had the \"wrong\" color palette compared to competing console games; Fries never showed the results to Bungie The game was released in North America simultaneously with the Xbox on November 15 2001 a novel to was released a few weeks before the game Science fiction author penned the novel in seven weeks The novel was nearly killed halfway to completion; Nylund credits Trautmann with saving it became a bestseller with almost two hundred thousand copies sold The following novel entitled is a to describing not only the experiences of the Master Chief but also those of other characters on Installation 04 Written by this novel appeared

reception was largely positive the game received criticism for its level design GameSpy commented \"you ll trudge through countless hallways and control rooms that all look exactly the same fighting identical-looking groups of enemies over and over and over it is simply frustrating to see a game with such groundbreaking sequences too often degenerate [into] this kind of mindless repetitive action \" Similarly an article on Game Studies org remarked \"In the latter part of the game the scenarios rely on repetition and quantity rather than innovativeness and quality \" concluded \"Halo is very much a game of two halves The first half is fast exciting beautifully designed and constantly full of surprises The second half is festooned with gobsmacking plot twists and great cinematics but let down by repetitive paint by numbers level design \" was released prior to the launch of Xbox Live and the lack of both online multiplayer and bots to simulate human players was criticized by GameSpy;

modernizing the FPS genre According to GameSpot s \"numerous subtle innovations have been borrowed by countless other games since \" The game is often cited as the main reason for the Xbox s success and it began what is commonly regarded as the system s flagship franchise Game designer credited the game with using science-fiction environments to follow in eschewing static levels and a similarity

UNSC forces under John-117 participates in a mission to rescue Captain Keyes from the Covenant cruiser After rescuing the Captain Cortana learns that appears to be a weapon that holds great religious significance to the Covenant Realizing that the Covenant cannot be allowed to control Halo Keyes dispatches John-117 to secure Halo s control room while he leaves with Johnson to secure a Covenant weapons cache With UNSC Marines as support John-117 leads an assault on the a map room which holds information on every location on the ring including the control room Heading to the ring s control room Cortana is inserted into the ring s computer system and learns that Halo was made by the an ancient alien race that the Covenant worship as gods However Cortana soon learns that there is something else on Halo something that terrifies the Covenant Frightened she says that John has to stop Keyes from accessing the \"weapons cache\" before it is too late John-117 leaves for the last

squad encountering a new threat: the The Flood is a parasitic species which received their name due to the way they assimilate all resistance with overwhelming numbers Free for the first time in a hundred thousand years the Flood sweeps across Halo devastating Human and Covenant forces alike The release of the Flood prompts the eccentric AI of the ring to activate Halo s defense systems The AI instructs the SPARTAN-II to activate Halo by obtaining the from the Installation s The Chief does so battling hordes of Flood along the way and returns to the control room Before Halo initiates its systems Cortana intervenes and tells John the truth about the Forerunner structure and its purpose- Halo was designed to eliminate the Flood threat by starving the Flood of any life source large enough to sustain them; when fired it would essentially wipe out all sentient life in the galaxy Realizing the threat of Halo Cortana instructs John-117 to detonate the s fusion reactor This detonation would result in the destruction of Halo which was against 343 Guilty Spark s protocol Before doing so the two sabotage three generators needed to power Halo which buys them enough time to locate Captain Keyes now succumbed to the Flood and steal his neural implants to operate the After battling his way through scattered and disorganized Covenant forces the spreading Flood and the Sentinels under direct command of 343 Guilty Spark John-117 successfully overloads the ship s engine and he and Cortana evacuate from Halo in a before the s engine detonates and destroys Halo The pair appears to be the only survivors and John-117 realizes that they are simply beginning a harrowing battle s gameplay was characterized by several features which set it apart from less acclaimed first-person shooter games of its time Movement in is similar to other first-person shooters allowing the player to move forwards backwards and strafe left and right including diagonally and jumping independently of their aim On the Xbox moving and aiming are normally separated between the two analogue sticks and on the between the keyboard and the mouse also allows the player to crouch and jump although jumping from a high ledge will often result in death or at least major fall damage Damage from falling can be reduced or negated entirely with a well-timed crouch right as one lands Additionally if the player he will be able to land on something slightly taller than if he were to jump without crouching Also if the player is jumping from a cliff he can make sure he is touching the wall periodically while he is falling This will count as if he is touching floor and every time the player touches the wall the damage counter goes to zero there is no visible damage counter during gameplay features a wide variety of environments including human and Covenant starships ancient buildings on itself and expansive outdoor climates The first level is fought entirely on the human starship of the same name The next level takes place in a temperate highland climate with open-air Forerunner structures scattered about This level also contains the famous \"Blue Beam Towers\" begin in a rocky desert but the setting changes to the titular Covenant cruiser about one-third of the way through occurs on a tropical island with substantial combat both outdoors and inside futuristic Forerunner installations takes place in a snowy icy area of towering cliffs and underground tunnels as well as high-tech suspension bridges and oft-repeated Forerunner structures built into and through cliff walls is a significant departure from these majestic environments with combat in gloomy exotic swamps and equally gloomy underground complexes that host the player s introduction to the Flood The player is then teleported to the second of three entirely indoor levels encountering repetitive forbidding hallways and massive elevators Master Chief returns to the snowy climate of Assault on the Control Room for visiting almost no new areas but interestingly travelling in the opposite direction occurs in the same Covenant ship from albeit now heavily damaged but this time the Flood are present in huge numbers Finally is set on the Pillar of Autumn with three major differences: the presence of the Flood the heavy structural damage and access to the Engineering section and service corridors of the ship which were previously off-limits In total six of the ten levels feature a substantial amount of combat outdoors In the player has a limited non-regenerating which can be fully restored by picking up Running completely out of health will result in death but having lower health does not impede player actions A player s health can be reduced only if his shields have been depleted If the player s health is at minimal levels they will faintly hear John-117 s heartbeat Serving as the first layer of protection is the shielding system specially built for the The shield will decrease in strength every time it is hit by a weapon and will fail after taking too many hits or freefall from certain altitude The amount of shield drain depends on the attacker s weapon but will quickly regenerate if it is not hit for a brief period of time The shield represents a marked departure from most first-person shooters in which one s health bar is basically augmented by picking up \"armor\" In splatter kills are an easy task for all vehicles With a simple touch most characters including John-117 and can die instantly This also includes the Shade Turret; if the Turret moves and hits someone the victim will die instantly Fall damage also has limits; if falling speed exceeds the maximum shield and health cap the player will be killed instantly regardless of whether they are touching a wall in the environment though the damage can be nullified if player is using vehicles unless out of bounds Scorpion tanks and Warthogs are invulnerable to any attack with damage taken to either vehicles will instead be applied to the driver Ghosts and Banshees however can be destroyed if the pilot is mounting it The campaign in can be played by single-player or cooperatively In the second player takes control of an identical copy of the Master Chief This second player however will not appear in any cutscene in the game The game s campaign consists of ten levels: Up to four players can play together using the same-console splitscreen mode It is also possible for up to 16 players to play together in one game over a using Xbox and/or Xbox 360 consoles that have been connected through an hub or via Xbox Connect The game s seamless support for this type of play and a few large maps that can accommodate up to 16 combatants is a first for console games Since the game was released before the launch of Xbox Live mainstream online play was not available for this title A total of 13 multiplayer maps are available: On July 21 1999 during the Macworld Conference &amp; Expo Steve Jobs announced that would be released for Mac OS and Windows simultaneously Before this public announcement game industry journalists under a non-disclosure agreement had previewed the game in a private showing during and were reportedly amazed Bungie Studios later stated an even earlier development build of the game centered on and was \"basically in a sci-fi universe \" At the first trailer of was well-received The version shown there differed greatly from the one exhibited previously marking the first major overhaul in the game s development At this point was a third-person action game in which a transport starship crashlands on a mysterious ring world that orbits a star Early versions of Covenant aliens appear in great numbers and loot what they can and war erupts between them and the humans Unable to match the technologically advanced alien race the humans on the ring world resort to guerrilla warfare This version of the game featured -specific fauna which were later dropped because of design difficulties and the creatures \"detract from the surprise drama and impact of the Flood \" announced on June 19 2000 that it had acquired Bungie Studios became an exclusive game for Microsoft s and Bungie Studios rewrote the game s engine heavily altering its presentation and turning it into a Originally a key element the game s online multiplayer component was dropped because would be unfinished at the time of s release While a playable demonstration of the game at Gamestock 2001 was well-received critics had mixed reactions to its exhibition at E3 2001 Roughly 90% of the final product was developed in just nine months of development with team members working 16–20 hours a day for six days per week between January and October 2001 The novel by was commissioned by Microsoft to serve as a prequel to During the writing of Bungie reportedly almost cancelled the novel but was convinced by to approve it in exchange for himself and writing an estimated \"80 percent\" of the in-game dialogue of The dysfunctional relationship between Bungie and the Microsoft team working on the game created some disconnect - the notorious \"this cave is not a natural formation\" line was caused by Bungie promising that the environment would not be immediately obvious as an artificial formation According to Trautmann a number of Bungie employees resented the presence of Microsoft employees The game was released in North America simultaneously with the Xbox on November 15 2001; the \"Combat Evolved\" subtitle was an addition by marketers at Microsoft who felt that alone was not a descriptive enough title to compete with other military-themed games s soundtrack was created by audio director and received a large amount of praise from many critics Martin O Donnell has stated that his goal was to provide \"a feeling of importance weight and sense of the ancient \" He designed the music so that it \"could be dissembled and remixed in such a way that would give [him] multiple interchangeable loops that could be randomly recombined in order to keep the piece interesting as well as a variable length\" Development involved the creation of \"alternative middle sections that could be transitioned to if the game called for such a change i e less or more intense \" Martin O Donnell has remarked that he \"sat with the level designers and spotted the level as though it was a movie with the knowledge that the music would have to be malleable rather than static [T]he level designer would tell me what he hoped a player would feel at certain points or after accomplishing certain tasks\" Based on this information O Donnell would \"go back and develop appropriate music cues then have the designer script the cues into the level and then we d play through it to see if it worked as desired \" He explained that the use of music in is sparse because he believes that \"[music] is best used in a game to quicken the emotional state of the player and it works best when used least\" and that \"[if] music is constantly playing it tends to become sonic wallpaper and loses its impact when it is needed to truly enhance some dramatic component of game play \" composed and produced by and for the video game is one CD comprising 26 tracks Some editions include a bonus DVD with game trailers for Most of the music from is present on the CD although some songs are remixed and some tracks are intermixed with others in medley form It was released in 2001 In 2000 at E3 Bungie showed off a trailer of the upcoming game to the public This trailer featured Marines along with the Master Chief scouting out a Forerunner structure and the Covenant fighting them During this trailer there was still no active AI so all the Covenant was actually controlled by Bungie This trailer was before the conversion to the Xbox as an FPS Before was released a series of cryptic emails were sent to The emails were supposedly written by Cortana but the contents written were greatly out of her character Her hacking skills however were shown having some of the messages from other email accounts and even from the 1 3 version of the Bungie game CD These messages provided a small glimpse of the Trilogy plot The game shipped with a game disc and a detailing how to play the game and why everything is happening so far in the story was the main launch title for Xbox and is said to be the game that made the Xbox what it is today It was widely renowned for saving the fledgling Xbox platform as the Xbox lacked any titles to compete with Sony s

Review This remaster of a remake now rocks 4K graphics at a silky 60fps The Bottom Line Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary is an outstanding first-person shooter that remains a joy to play nearly a decade after its original release This remastered version looks and plays great but audio bugs and downgraded Classic visuals sully the experience Pros Cons Halo: Combat Evolved is the game that sparked a beloved Microsoft franchise and put the original Xbox on the map It reimagined the first-person shooter FPS genre for consoles and popularized many of the controls and functions that such games would use for decades afterward Halo received an enhanced remake in 2011 for the Xbox 360 Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary that featured updated graphics and a toggle function that lets you swap between Classic and Remastered visual styles Now that Anniversary edition gets updated with 4K graphics ultrawide monitor support and other features you d expect from a contemporary It s an outstanding Editors Choice-worthy remastering one that only suffers from niggling audio and visual issues Like Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary can be enjoyed as a part of the $39 99 Halo: Master Chief Collection or on its own for $9 99 It’s also one of the games available in Microsoft’s excellent Xbox Game Pass service Combat Evolved After a bombastic opening that sees your spaceship crash land on an alien ring world you—as Master Chief—must fight through Covenant forces to rescue fellow marines while also piecing together the mystery behind the world s existence Halo has a relatively limited enemy roster so the combat becomes visually repetitive as you play through the campaign Still the makes excellent use of pacing challenge and storytelling to keep the fight engaging for a surprisingly long time   In addition to the potent marine and alien weaponry you tote into battle Halo often doles out vehicles for you to pilot which changes the fight dynamics For example the iconic Warthog—an armored turret-mounted Jeep—can be driven across a wide range of terrain and even inside many structures This gives you a huge advantage over grounded Covenant grunts especially if you get a fellow marine to man the turret Throughout the story campaign you come across various other Covenant and marine vehicles including speedy alien hover bikes and beefy rocket-pumping tanks   Similar Products Halo: Reach for PC Halo 5: Forge for PC Halo: The Master Chief Collection for Xbox One Perhaps the subtlest yet most satisfying way that Halo keeps things fresh is through its storytelling scenarios You move from escape sequences to marine rescue missions to unnerving survival-horror levels all the while battling hordes of dangerous enemies   Alien Nation The Covenant alien species your primary Halo adversaries only manifest as a few basic enemy types That said the game introduces tougher variants as you progress through the story A few more surprise enemies join the battle during the game s later chapters but even with their presence the enemy variety is relatively sparse   Once you make it out of Halo s tutorial sequence the brakes are off and there is very little in the way of handholding The Covenant is noticeably more aggressive once you crash on the titular Halo and the difficulty only ramps up from there The enemy forces drip with personality so even the basic adversaries take cover flee or flank you if you let them Grunts for example are aggressive cannon fodder who are prone to panicking and running around in disarray Still they can tear you to shreds and they love hurling grenades right when you turn the tide against them Elites mirror Master Chief s abilities in that they can shield themselves from damage use cover and evade shots They also perform mid-fight taunts to wound your ego Covenant armament has a massive impact on how you approach alien forces Basic plasma-shooting enemies are dangerous but their shots are straight and easy to evade Anything armed with a Needler a crystal-shooting firearm with limited homing abilities is decidedly more lethal and should generally be a priority target Elites can also be armed with a plasma sword which drops you instantly if their swing lands Missions mix these enemies into pretty much every encounter which radically affects how you approach each fight Bugs and Oddities Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary like Halo: Reach has a few audio problems The plasma pistol for example often produces a charging shot sound even if the gun isn t being charged For context that sound should only play when the shoot button is held down to beef up the next shot and not during normal shooting as I often encountered it A harsh grating sound is another audio bug that I ve encountered You ll notice it when you walk near certain walls It s really noticeable when you play through the Silent Cartographer mission but you can catch it in a few other missions if you listen closely Most disappointingly I encountered graphical issues while playing with Classic visuals activated The shielded enemies Jackals as they re called tote relatively simple plastic-looking shields In the original Halo release these shields would crackle with dynamic energy and change color as you damage them with gunfire to signify that they were weakening I found it extremely odd that the shields didn t do that anymore to the point that I began to ask myself if I had imagined that detail Considering the amount of flourish poured into Halo I decided to poke around and see what else seemed amiss It wasn t long before I realized that all transparent or opaque game items were severely downgraded from the original Xbox release Covenant barriers and shields all look like flat plastic glass surfaces look cloudy and Cortana doesn’t change color when she s angry   Those are subtle details to be sure but they begin to add up and to create a version of classic Halo that is noticeably flatter than the original disc release back in 2001   Another oddity: While the game runs at a solid 60 frames per second fps or even higher plasma swords and gunshots seem to run at a capped 30fps They re jarring to look at when you play at higher frame rates   In addition the game s bump mapping appears flat compared with the original Xbox game Many of the walls and structures were riddled with grooves and paneling that made surfaces pop Apparently Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary s surfaces still have those bump maps but they look flat until you shine a direct light on them I didn t even notice this effect until I took my Warthog vehicle further into a complex than I think was intended The car s headlights illuminated all the pretty textures in a way that was noticeably jarring as I got out of the car and the headlights went out I was plunged into a bland flat room and all the wonderful textures were virtually imperceptible Only when I got back in the Warthog or when I used my flashlight did the textures reappear As I explored environments within each mission I encountered numerous surfaces with this same issue I learned that many of these visual bugs are the result of the PC porting process back in 2002 when Bungie outsourced the task to Gearbox Software This Gearbox version of the original Halo: Combat Evolved suffers from broken bump mapping transparency problems broken fog effects and so on This version of Halo is the one that has been used for the Anniversary edition and the Master Chief Collection and while 343 Industries is hard at work fixing bugs that arise in this collection this is yet another group of issues to add to the ever-growing pile   Naturally these issues seem to affect only the original version of Halo: Combat Evolved The Remastered visuals look fine for the most part but I am a touch disappointed that the MCC version of the original Halo isn t visually faithful to the original game and oftentimes makes the original look much worse than it actually was   Smooth Gameplay Despite a few laggy hiccups at the very start of the game publisher Xbox Game Studios delivers an excellent Halo experience The game doesn’t demand too much from your The minimum specs require either an AMD Phenom II X4 960T or Intel i3550 CPU AMD HD 6850 or Nvidia GeForce GTS 450 GPU 20GB of disk space and the Windows 7 operating system Unfortunately the RAM requirement isn t listed on the or Microsoft store pages My gaming PC one sporting an Intel i5-4690 CPU and Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 GPU pushed the game at a smooth 60fps Like Halo: Reach Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary can be enjoyed with and which feels just as intuitive and natural as a controller Likewise it also has a wealth of Steam achievements to earn in-game as well as those addictive trading cards to collect and trade Note that in addition to the usual Steam DRM you will also need an Xbox Live account to play the Master Chief Collection Fortunately you do not need to subscribe to Xbox Live Gold to enjoy playing with others online: just create a basic Xbox Live account and you’re good to go I absolutely love being able to shift between the original Halo visuals and the updated graphics by pressing the Tab key The Remastered graphics are much brighter than the Classic visuals as they feature new lighting and textures However the original game s feel is lost with the updated visuals particularly the interiors which look much more sterile and generic The crude alien edges and bizarre glyphs that made the original release distinct is no more Nonetheless it s great that both versions are included The game support ultrawide too Experience a Legend Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary is a fantastic first-person shooter and we had so much fun replaying the game that our criticisms fell to the wayside Besides the occasional audio and visual quirks that popped up Halo is a wonderfully polished game that feels just as engrossing and accessible today as it did back in the day Consider this Editors Choice a must-have purchase if you re itching to send aliens into the afterlife If you liked this review and would like to see more please join the   There you ll find

simplicity shared by the brutal corridors and wide expanses of Halo’s levels Blocky cliffs and simple textures betray its age but Halo still hits that sharp tone of wondrous unease Firefights are punctuated by long stretches of silence leaving you alone with the ambient hum of an ancient world Ancient aliens are a worn trope but not even later Halo games could paint a world as enduringly old as the first While the real horror doesn’t start until the late game Halo warns against complacency from the start The ringworld’s forests are lush but startlingly lifeless Every minute spent above ground in dazzling sunlight is matched by a trip into Halo’s interior—a sterile maze of corridors antechambers and bottomless pits accompanied by the echoes of machinery older than you’d ever care to guess Every fight waged against the Covenant paints violent scars on structures that have very visibly stood untouched for millennia I suppose it’s time to address the elephant in the room Halo returns to PC as Halo: CE Anniversary an updated version of Sabre Interactive’s 2011 remaster Anniversary’s corrections are something of a sticking point for long-term Halo fans Every last model and texture has been completely redone to be more detailed every level packed with fancy new lighting and particle effects The level where the parasitic zombie-like Flood are introduced—once a masterclass in building tension—is utterly sapped of tone by the saturated new visuals On the odd occasion it works There’s a particular beauty to watching the sun glint off a dropship’s bow as it descends into a sun-dappled valley Natural landscapes generally tend to get off more lightly Bungie’s original environments had a sparse appeal but they were exceptionally blocky affairs But Halo’s quiet ambience is lost in Sabre’s everything goes approach to remastering   Brutal barren structures that could have once been made of concrete are now a mess of metal and lights and holograms The level where the parasitic zombie-like Flood are introduced—once a masterclass in building tension—is utterly sapped of tone by the saturated new visuals As both visual modes use the same collision meshes you’ll frequently find invisible walls around Anniversary s trees which lack the girth of their 2001 ancestors Rough as the visuals are I wasn’t prepared for the shock of Anniversary’s reworked audio The new gun sounds put into sharp focus how well Bungie nailed the nebulous sensation of gun feel Halo does at least keep Anniversary’s neatest trick With the tap of a button you can swap between remastered visuals and Bungie’s original art At 60 FPS and with the widescreen and field-of-view support the Gearbox 2003 port never offered those old assets get the job done This release does unfortunately carry through some of the 2003 port’s missing effects For the most part they’re hard to notice—just don’t look up during Assault on the Control Room Combat Evolved’s multiplayer makes it through entirely untouched by Anniversary’s meddling It’s all here including the new maps weapons and vehicles included in the 2003 PC port What it’s lacking is mods Halo’s best maps for my money were created for the highly-moddable Custom Edition that shipped free alongside Gearbox’s release The Master Chief Collection doesn’t have much in the way of modding yet What it can offer instead is a more complete multiplayer picture The Gearbox port is a hassle to pick up these days and it’s packed with servers dead-set on playing Blood Gulch 24/7 Within the MCC’s matchmaking ecosystem I’ve gotten to play games on maps and modes I’d long written off I’m usually the first to lament the loss of dedicated servers but damn if it isn’t just fun to get a full round of Oddball running on Damnation That’s really the appeal in seeing Halo return to PC like this Packaged with the rest of the Master Chief Collection it’s an easy way to hop in and see what all the fuss was about 20 years ago If you’ve spent the last 20 years moulding Halo PC into a custom content chimaera it’s a harder sell What Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary is offering a clean slate The definitive edition of Halo: Combat

            "Earth, 2019. A team of US scientists makes a frightening discovery on an island in the South China Sea. All contact with the team is lost when the North Korean Government quickly seals off the area. The United States responds by dispatching an elite team of Delta Force Operators to recon the situation. As tension rises between the two nations, a massive alien ship reveals itself in the middle of the island. The ship generates an immense force sphere that freezes a vast portion of the island and drastically alters the global weather system. Now the US and North Korea must join forces to battle the alien menace. With hope rapidly fading, you must fight epic battles through tropical jungle, frozen landscapes, and finally into the heart of the alien ship itself for the ultimate Zero G showdown.</description>\n",

a race of technologically advanced aliens known as the Ceph who arrived on Earth millions of years ago and have recently been awakened The series consists of three main installments a standalone spinoff of the first game with a separate multiplayer title and a compilation A fourth game under the of was announced by Crytek on January 26 2022 Contents Characters in use nanosuits advanced developed by the U S military that grants them special abilities through dedicated \"modes\" as well as the ability to switch between them at will Nanosuit s \"armor mode\" enhances the suit s ability to withstand bullet and shrapnel impacts \"strength mode\" greatly enhances the wearer s physical strength to the point of being able to punch cars through the air; and \"speed mode\" allows the wearer to run and act extremely fast Lastly \"cloak mode\" activates the suit s optical that makes the wearer near-invisible The first two games and take place in 2020 on the fictional Lingshan Islands off the Philippines The protagonists of both games both belong to the fictitious \"Raptor Team\" a operation that is sent to the island to investigate aggressive behavior by North Korea The player uses various weapons including traditional projectile weapons like handguns submachine guns assault rifles and sniper rifles all of which can be modified with scopes and attachments in real-time as well as explosives and the nanosuit s natural abilities Multiplayer gameplay modes introduce fictional futuristic weapons based on the ice technology introduced by the alien antagonists who are later found to reside on the island In single-player Raptor Team faces off against both the North Korean military and these alien foes the sequel to the original game takes place in 2023 in The protagonist is a new character a U S Marine named Alcatraz The nanosuit in the game dubbed \"Nanosuit 2\" is a streamlined version of the original without separate \"strength\" and \"speed\" modes rather performing context-sensitive acts of enhanced strength or agility but retaining the separate \"armor\" and \"cloak\" modes Release timeline After Helena Rosenthal sends a distress signal saying the North Koreans are invading the seemingly unimportant island on which her team is working the US government dispatches Raptor Team a group of nanosuit-clad soldiers After arriving on the island however Raptor Team s ranks are thinned by mysterious flying creatures eventually leaving only Nomad Psycho and Prophet who is subsequently kidnapped by the organisms later called the Ceph Nomad rescues Helena but is eventually trapped in the alien ship after it unleashes an \"ice sphere\" on the island freezing a great deal of the island Nomad escapes the island with Helena and an oddly-behaving Prophet and returns to the US carrier fleet where he finds Psycho Prophet returns to the island which is subsequently nuked in the attempt to kill the aliens However they only grow stronger from the energy The aliens launch a massive attack on the carrier fleet successfully destroying it Nomad Psycho and Helena escape and receive a distress signal from the still-alive Prophet and decide to return to the island During Psycho s own mission he was sent to retrieve a captured alien from Colonel Lee and the Koreans After numerous setbacks and the assistance of his friend O Neill Psycho successfully defeats Lee obtains the alien and brings it back to the carrier fleet At this point the story continues in the original title A sequel set 3 years after the original game takes place in in 2023 which is infected by an unknown virus The player controls Alcatraz a U S Marine who is found almost dead by Prophet and given the upgraded Nanosuit 2 before Prophet commits suicide He is tasked by Prophet to rescue a scientist named Nathan Gould At first Alcatraz has to face Crynet s CELL agents a mercenary force who is hired by the to police the chaotic still thinking that Alcatraz is Prophet who is infected by the virus After discovering Ceph capsules and Catalyst the Ceph take over as the main antagonists for the rest of the game Alcatraz and Gould team up with Tara Strickland an undercover CIA lieutenant and Jacob Hargreave the original creator of the nanosuit Alcatraz eventually enters the Ceph core spire and wipes out all the Ceph in New York Now facing death again he meets a memory pattern of Prophet whose DNA is merged into Alcatraz s The game closes with Alcatraz being contacted by Karl Rasch a nanosuit scientist and vowing to continue the war against the Ceph As with its predecessor again takes place in New York Set in 2047 the game sees Prophet return to the now nanodome-encased New York City on a mission of revenge against CELL having uncovered the truth behind their motives for building the quarantined nanodomes With being the end of the trilogy Crytek teased that the series would have a \"radical future\" Yerli confirmed that the

high system requirements The phrase has continued in modern usage as a with any other high-end or ironically low-end game title replacing Crysis developed by Crytek Budapest received largely positive reviews Most reviewers praised the improvements over the original in areas like AI and gameplay pacing citing the original game s criticism that battles were few and far between The new protagonist Psycho was also received better than the original s less developed Nomad The revamped multiplayer mode was also praised for adding a team deathmatch mode the lack of which most reviewers criticized in the original game Criticism of the game by reviewers includes the short story mode and a lack of new features over the original game Some continued to cite the game s high system requirements as unacceptable even a year after the original game which has the same requirements Indeed some reviewers did not see any significant performance improvement with compared with stating that only high-end

game to feature support for the system s peripheral which initially came bundled with retail copies of the game Since its release in 1997 the game has sold over 4 million copies making it the best-selling game in the series and the ninth The game received critical acclaim for its precise controls voice acting multiplayer modes and replayability through the use of branching gameplay paths Like the SNES game before it has been deemed one of the A stereoscopic 3D remake for the was released in 2011 and a reimagining for the was released in 2016 This game has been released on the Expansion Pack service on October 25 2021 its launch date Contents is a 3D game in which the player controls one of the vehicles piloted by usually an Most of the game takes place in \"Corridor Mode\" which forces Fox s vehicle down an on-rails path straight forward through the environment In Corridor Mode the player s vehicle can be maneuvered around the screen to dodge obstacles and can also perform a somersault to get behind enemies or dodge projectiles The Arwing is also capable of deflecting enemy fire while performing a spinning maneuver called a \"barrel roll\" actually an in real-life aviation terms The Arwing and Landmaster can charge up their laser cannons to unleash a powerful lock-on laser In addition to Corridor Mode some stages of the game including multiplayer and most boss fights take place in \"All-Range Mode\" In this variant the player can move freely in a three-dimensional space within the confines of a large arena The Arwing can also perform one new maneuver in All-Range Mode: a to change direction Throughout the game the player can fly or drive through power-ups to collect them These include silver and gold rings that refill the vehicle s shields upgrade its lasers repair its wings or grant extra lives Returning from the original are that fly beside the player in Arwings and are sometimes pursued into the player s by enemies If the player fails to defeat the enemies chasing a wingman that wingman may be forced to retreat to the mothership for repairs The wingman will then be unavailable to start the next stage but may return if enough time passes Each wingman provides a different form of assistance to the player: scans bosses and displays their shields on the player s screen provides gameplay advice and occasionally locates alternate routes through stages Some stages also feature special appearances from supporting characters that assist the team The game features a branching level system in which more difficult paths are unlocked by completing certain objectives Players can also change paths once the current mission is accomplished All of the game s possible routes start at Corneria eventually put the player in contact with the and end at Venom with a confrontation with Andross To add replay challenge the game also features awardable medals which are earned by accomplishing a mission with all wingmen intact and having achieved a certain hit total Obtaining medals unlocks bonus features such as new multiplayer vehicles cosmetic changes to Fox in single player and additional game settings such as \"Expert Mode\" The is the primary craft used by the Star Fox team The Arwing can use its boost meter to perform four special techniques to avoid collisions and get the drop on pursuers: boost brake somersault and U-Turn A -like vehicle called the Landmaster is used for two levels in the game Macbeth and Titania Like the Arwing the Landmaster can boost and brake but it cannot somersault It can perform a barrel roll but since it lacks an Arwing s force field the Landmaster s barrel roll does not reflect enemy fire The Landmaster can also hover a short while The Blue-Marine a is available solely on the water planet Aquas The Blue-Marine can upgrade its twin lasers but it cannot make use of Smart Bombs It makes up for this with an unlimited supply of which not only damage enemies but also produce bright bursts of light allowing the player to see in the ocean depths The torpedoes can also lock-on to enemies just as the charged up lasers can in the other vehicles The submersible also has a shot-deflecting barrel roll in addition to boost and brake capabilities features support for up to four players simultaneously At first users can only play using the Arwing spaceship but by earning certain medals in the main campaign players can unlock the Landmaster tank and fight on foot as one of the four members of Star Fox equipped with a bazooka Multiplayer is the only place where players

which the last player left wins and a \"time trial\" to destroy enemy fighters The game s protagonist and playable character is a and leader of the Star Fox team who defends the Lylat system His father James was part of the original Star Fox team who was killed by Andross before the start of the game Andross a scientist from Corneria who was exiled to Venom after he nearly destroyed the

energetic expert of the team and a falcon who is cocky but an excellent fighter Helping the Star Fox team on their mission to defeat Andross are General Pepper a bloodhound and leader of a militia force in Corneria; Bill Grey a bulldog friend of Fox and commander of the Bulldog and Husky units; Katt Monroe a friend and former fellow gang member of Falco; and ROB 64 NUS64 in the Japanese version

Andross launches an attack across the Lylat system Defending Corneria Pepper summons the new Star Fox team now consisting of Fox Peppy Falco and Slippy While traveling through several planets the team battles with several of Andross henchmen including the rival mercenaries Star Wolf After the team arrives at Venom Fox confronts and defeats Andross alone Reunited with the Star Fox team Fox returns

the skies Two endings are available depending on whether Fox approaches Venom and defeats Andross The Easy route ending occurs when Fox arrives from Bolse and destroys a robotic version of Andross leaving Andross drifting in the Lylat System In the Hard route ending from Area 6 Fox reveals Andross true form as that of a floating brain and kills him Shortly before his death Andross activates his base s self-destruct system in a last-ditch attempt to take Fox out However James is revealed to still be alive and leads Fox out from Venom In a post-credits scene Pepper receives a bill from Star Fox presenting the number of enemies killed and multiplies it by 64 resulting in the amount of money due If the price is between $50 000 and $69 999 between 781 and 1 093 enemies killed he will say \"This is one steep bill but it s worth it \" If the price is over $70 000 1 094 or more he says \"What?!\" At this point the bill is stamped Following the release of in 1993 series creator began working on for the SNES By 1995 Miyamoto and team had largely finished development of before realizing that its release would require the use of an additional chip the Super FX 2 which would increase the cost of the game Furthermore newly launched competitor consoles namely the and the possessed processing power and graphics capabilities that dwarfed those of the SNES making appear obsolete Recognizing this and that the would launch the following year with significantly increased processing power and graphical capabilities Miyamoto made the decision to cancel in favor of developing a new game for the Nintendo 64 Following the cancellation of Miyamoto and team began work on The team cribbed heavily from the work that had been done in and stating in an interview that roughly 30% of s gameplay came from the original game roughly 60% came from the cancelled sequel and the remaining 10% was original work done during the development of In particular Miyamoto said: \"All-Range Mode Multi-Player Mode and the Star Wolf scenario all came from \" One new aspect of gameplay was the addition of levels that used the Landmaster tank and the Blue-Marine submarine which were conceived of by members of the development team rather than Miyamoto himself in response to Miyamoto s suggestion that the game include a \"human-type craft\" which the team generally did not approve of The team originally intended for the game to contain multiple underwater levels but ultimately scaled back as they found that the underwater levels slowed down the pacing of the game With the underlying gameplay largely complete early in development Miyamoto and the team focused the majority of their efforts on graphics audio and dialogue and enemy AI seeking to harness the new processing power provided by the Nintendo 64 For example when developing the animation sequences for the team worked to make the characters mouths pop open and closed along with their audio This reduced the amount of animation work put into the series and was inspired by the way puppets appear to talk as Miyamoto was a fan of the British puppet-based show The development team also realized that adding dynamic audio would enhance the 3D gameplay experience as the player s allies could audibly signal when the player was being pursued by an offscreen enemy unit In writing dialogue for the game s characters the developers sought to invoke more traditional historical dramas adding more conventional lines such as \"I ve been waiting for you Star Fox\" and \"You re becoming more like your father \" Edgier dialogue such as \"I guess it s your turn to be thankful\" was written for the character Falco Lombardi while more supportive dialogue such as \"Never give up Trust your instincts!\" came from the character Peppy Hare was also the first title to make use of the peripheral which came bundled with the game in some instances Miyamoto stated that the development team struggled to utilize the Rumble Pak in a way that players understood noting that during development players were often confused as to why their control was rumbling The game was first shown publicly at where Nintendo released a video of an early version of the game This early version of the game showcased only the first level Corneria and featured a minimalistic HUD showing only a crude meter reflecting the player s shield gauge Nintendo released further beta footage of the game on December 6 1996 that showed subsequent levels an improved HUD and a short multiplayer segment As the game approached launch Nintendo became concerned that the title \"Star Fox\" could be considered too similar to the name of the company \"StarVox\" Thus like its predecessor the game was rebranded as in certain PAL territories subscribers received a promotional video prior to s release the same tactic was used to promote for the SNES as well as and for the Nintendo 64 that advertised the game s cinematic presentation as well as new features like the Rumble Pak and voice acting It revolves around two agents of and who at the time were Nintendo s biggest hardware competitors interrogating a Nintendo employee into revealing information about the game Years after release a substantial number of unused assets were found on the cartridge including unused icons audio files levels and power-ups In an interview post-release Miyamoto said that while he was not 100% satisfied with the final version of he felt that the game made better use of the Nintendo 64 s increased processing power than which was a launch title for the console and which Miyamoto had also developed Aggregate scores Review scores received critical acclaim and was one of the top-selling games of 1997 second to Reviews hailed the level branching system particularly its use of player performance and secret in-level triggers rather than simple path selection Many reviewers also praised the multiplayer modes as an ample source of replay value with in particular stating they \"give a boost over other shooters \" However Crispin Boyer of EGM considered them a waste contending that the split screen display made targets too small to pinpoint The game s voice clips were widely complimented not for the quality of the acting but for the unprecedented quantity of audio clips for a cartridge-based game Critics also applauded the precise analog control boss designs Rumble Pak implementation and cinematic cutscenes which gave the game a perfect 5 out of 5 in all four categories elaborated \"The analog joystick seriously kicks it here with its best performance to date demonstrating impressively crisp response that enables you to pull the tight white-knuckle moves you need to survive The Rumble Pak teams up with the solid controls and scores as an all-time great add-on \" The most common criticism was that was not as much of a leap over the original particularly compared to s improvement over previous games due to the gameplay still being on rails This perceived shortcoming did little to dull critics response to the game however reviewer declared \"an instant classic\" and \"a pleasure to look at\" gave it their \"Game of the Month\" award with Dan Hsu calling it \"a shooting fan s dream come true\" and Shawn Smith \"almost as good as Mario 64 \" reviewer Doug Perry said it \"demonstrates that shooters are more alive now than ever \" The review of the Wii Virtual Console version bestows a 7 6/10 praising its simple enjoyable shooting gameplay and much voice acting The review says the game is nice to look at regardless of its graphic age with added replay value in finding hidden paths but found the lack of rumble support \"alarming\" especially since it is the first game to support the Rumble Pak In the first five days of the game s U S launch more than 300 000 copies were sold surpassing the record previously held by and It sold above 1 million units in the United States by the end of 1997 one of five Nintendo 64 games to do so Sales were considerably less in Japan where it sold 75 595 copies during the first week of sale The game also took the #73 spot in \"Top 200 Nintendo Games Ever\" is listed as the 45th greatest game of all time by in 2009 In 1997 ranked it the 39th best console video game of all time citing its amazing visuals huge amount of voice acting and the deep challenge of earning medals on all stages and completing expert mode They also named it \"Shooter of the Year\" at their 1997 Editors Choice Awards At Nintendo announced a remake of for the titled Nintendo exhibited a demo the same day that emphasized the technology of the Nintendo 3DS The remake was co-developed by and features stereoscopic 3D graphics quality-of-life improvements gyroscope controls and brand new voice recordings The game was released on July 14 2011 in Japan and September 9 2011 in Europe and North America This marked the first time that had been released in PAL territories under the original name

64 Development Developer s Publisher s Release Date s JP NA PAL CN Game Statistics Genre Player s Rating : 6 Game Technical s Platform Media Behind The Scenes Preceded By: Followed By: known in Australia and Europe as due to trademark issues is a scrolling shooting game developed and released by Nintendo in 1997 for the Nintendo 64 It is the second officially released Star Fox game as the originally planned second game in the series was canceled for physical release on the SNES due to the upcoming release of the Nintendo 64 but some of its features were reused in such as charged laser shots All-Range Mode and even the Star Wolf team It was the first game to introduce support for the N64 Controller s Rumble Pak and was packaged with one The game received positive ratings from reviewers and critics who praised its smooth animation detailed visuals and use of multiple gameplay paths was listed as the forty-fifth-greatest game of all time by Guinness World Records Gamer s Edition in 2009 and has been called one of the greatest games of all time and is the most popular game in the series and was also rereleased under the Player s Choice range due to high enough sales 10 years after the original N64 release was released for download purchase on the Virtual Console available on the Nintendo Wii later for the Wii U Virtual Console and now for the Nintendo Switch Online library This game also received a remake in 2011 It is a reboot of the original and the only game in the series to be released on the Nintendo 64 Contents Much like the original 1993 game the objective of the single player Main Game in is to take charge of the Star Fox team as Fox McCloud and uncover the game s fifteen missions that link together in a number of possible paths to the final objective: a show-down on Venom the home planet of the interplanetary tyrant Andross Throughout the variable adventures players will have to accomplish challenging objectives in order to reach and conquer every mission There are two different mission modes in the game; the primary 3-D scrolling mode where the vehicle is sent down a fixed route with variable pathways towards the Mission objective and an all-range introduced in from the originally unreleased 3-D scrolling Missions thrusts players forward into the conflict and requires intense split-second reactions while taking down enough targets and keeping all three teammates onboard to try and earn a Mission Medal Multiple paths are possible through these scrolling missions depending on the choices taken or gaming performance All-range mode missions enable the Arwing to maneuver in full 360-degrees within a confined 3D arena and to put the Arwing through radical combat maneuvers like loop-the-loops and high energy turns Graphically took full advantage of the power of the N64 to produce at the time authentic 3-D environments full of alien adversaries and allowed an almost cinematic experience when skimming over the surface of an alien sea weaving through the concrete canyons of a futuristic metropolis or dodging planetoids the size of mountains Between Missions the capabilities of the N64 treated players to real-time 3-D movies that progressed the story of the Star Fox team of space mercenaries in their struggle against the evil ape emperor Andross The seamless transitions from action to story give a truly unique feel especially when equipping with the Rumble Pak to the Nintendo 64 Controller to become a new implement for fun was also developed with authentic sound effects and music add to the cinematic feel of the game with over 700 voice samples to allow for almost constant radio chatter between Fox McCloud and his wingmen even adding enemy characters to also get in on the act taunting Fox and his team as they oppose them The PAL version was also outfitted with an option to use the Lylat language format which is similar to spoken language in the original 1993 Not only does the Rumble Pak provide force-feedback in response to the game action the Controller s analog Control Stick gives the player total precise control of the specific vehicle dimensions and performances be it a sleek Arwing starfighter an armored Landmaster tank or the deep-diving Blue-Marine submersible Main Game aside up to four players can participate in three different Versus Mode matches: The first two options have Corneria and Sector Z as the possible stages while the time trial has Katina and Sector Z At first only the Arwing is available but the Landmaster is available after winning a medal on Venom in Normal Mode and an interesting Pilot mode is available after gaining a medal on all missions in Expert Mode The Arwing is also the primary vehicle in Versus Mode When the other two vehicle types are unlocked the Arwing is selected at the player s spawn point with A When Expert Mode is unlocked the Landmaster can be selected for use in Versus Mode by pressing B on the player s spawn screen In addition to the main goal to complete the stage every stage also has a secondary goal in the form of a target number of kills Once the player has gotten enough kills as long as all his allies are still alive his score will turn orange and he will be awarded a medal for that planet upon completion of the mission If the player earns medals on every mission he will have the option to play the main game in \"Expert Mode \" The music in   was composed by   and  The soundtrack has new themes that differ from the original title and introduced leitmotifs that have become a staple in the series including the Star Fox Team s theme \"Player s Choice\" edition of Nintendo Power subscribers received a promotional video prior to  s release the same tactic was used to promote   as well

roll European Despite or in Europe being only the second released game in the series Nintendo decided it was time for a reboot and so similarly to the this Nintendo 64 title sees exiled scientist Andross causing trouble in the Lylat system It s up to you as Fox McCloud and the rest of your Star Fox team to fight off his forces and save the day As before saving the day involves a lot of on-rails shooting action but there are plenty differences to the previous game besides the increased fidelity that came from 64-bit hardware Star Fox 64 takes some inspiration from the then-unreleased including the \"all-range mode\" the game switches to on occasion allowing free movement in an arena as you battle against enemy forces The new U-Turn manoeuvre is useful to get after a foe who has just whizzed past and a couple of the missions here see Fox take control of the tank-like Landmaster to provide a change of pace There s also a submarine mission too The game originally came bundled with the Nintendo 64 Rumble Pak which added some welcome feedback to the excellent controls as you duck dive blast and yes barrel roll your way through the branching levels avoiding impacts and explosions and generally shooting em up with the Star Fox team at your side The game is a lot of fun to play through the movement of your Arwing feeling natural as you either gently descend to collect a power-up or spin frantically to deflect enemy fire There s an epic feel to the game as you work through the missions and the battling varies depending on the situation The lock-on feature of your lasers is useful for getting rid of enemies but if there are a lot of them it s sometimes easier to just blast away – and of course you can \"use bombs wisely\" There are a few different paths through the Lylat System and how you do on a mission affects where you end up next There s a variety of planets visited and space battles too Sometimes you ll be dogfighting with enemies including the rival Star Wolf team and other times you ll be picking off waves of attackers and weaving between obstacles — brake boost and the new loop manoeuvre being deployed to get you through the stage in one piece Second Opinion It s debatable how well a lot of N64 games have aged but that s not a problem for Star Fox 64 It still looks fantastic is still an absolute peak in its genre and is wonderful on a 1st or 101st playthrough Its simplicity in approach is a strength and while these review second opinions are typically reserved for alternative views on a game I can t allow it This is a stone-cold classic that is wonderful to play It s ageless Thomas Whitehead Deputy Editor Visually there was a big step up from the SNES game; the extra power of the Nintendo 64 delivering more polygons which in combination with textures added far greater detail to the locations whilst cinematic moments help immerse you in the story Years later the SNES game has an eye-catchingly minimalist look but the greater visual complexity on show here holds up well too — it certainly moves along much more smoothly than the 16-bit title and there are plenty of wonderful looking environments to visit although the game s blockier moments do stand out these days Audio-wise there s some great hummable music; a mix of action and adventure that works well with the on-screen happenings Other tracks can be intense sounding and there are some very effective sound effects as you blast through the levels or crash into things Whereas the original Star Fox bar a few instances used a collection of sound effects to make up a language for the team s radio communications here they are fully voiced in English although the original PAL region release includes a Lylat babble if you prefer that Some duff line readings aside the chatter works well and adds to the excitement of the missions and the game s goofy B-movie vibe The game can be cleared quickly but the frantic action makes for enjoyable playthroughs; the multiple paths add some variety as well with the difficulty well-judged and steadily getting tougher as you progress Fluke your way through a tough mission and the difficulty increase is quite noticeable Do well on a mission and you will be awarded a medal and earning medals on all missions will keep you occupied for some time Also adding to the game s longevity is the multiplayer mode available for up to four players you can either blast away at each other or compete in a time trial mode where you shoot down as many enemy craft as possible in the allotted time Earning medals here unlocks some alternate ways to play these modes but however you choose to battle there s fun to be had if you can find three willing pilots Conclusion There s a lot of enjoyable battling as you weave about the screen taking out enemies and avoid colliding with obstacles in Star Fox 64 All-range mode and the tank and submarine missions add variety to your play through and the multiplayer mode provides plenty of fun The game can be cleared quickly but there are alternate paths to check out and medals to earn That all adds to the replayability but the main reason to return to this cinematic on-rails shooter is that it s still a total delight / Comments I still remember being wowed by the extensive use of voice acting as well as being treated to some really terrific and inspired music - all on a cartridge-based system that wasn t supposed to be able to handle stunning audio That the game was actually fun and really nice to look at was simply added value! Also the game debuted the Rumble Pak - which has been a built-in feature of nearly every console controller every since looks like star fox zero with slightly worse visuals The N64 era has aged very poorly I ll leave the games to my memory of playing them initially While I still think the 3DS version is superior in every aspect it s nice to have a look at the past This is one of the greatest shooters ever made Well I m surprised that this one is getting 9/10 while same reviewer I ve never played the original or the 3ds port and I m loving this Restore point function is surely welcome and this is I remapped the controls: ZR = Fire Laser ZL = Bomb Right Stick Up = Turbo This just keeps getting better and better with age Star Fox Zero has a lot to live up to but I am hopeful Does offer finsh today on eshop today? As I don t get internet till tomo According to the eShop the 50% offer is on until 21st April I would recommend anyone who s interested in this to get the 3DS version instead They really did a great job on updating the visuals and it really pops in 3D Well you haven t seen much of Star Fox Zero Surprise surprise Nintendo of America kills the VC yet again gamer Agreed Looks like this will be my first VC purchase! Hey Einstein! I m on your side! Does anyone know why Star Fox SNES has never been on VC? So excited to play this on the VC May Fox McCloud always fire his smart bombs straight and true Love this game! 10/10 Do a barrel roll! I was hoping this was already on NA s store I love the 3DS version but I still love playing the original too and I d like to upgrade to the Wii U VC version I actually feel that this particular game is one of the better aged N64 games But you can always play the 3DS version that updates the look of the game Could be something to do with the super FX chip that game used or they just don t feel it ll sell well it has aged rather poorly I can t stop playing this I loved it back in the day but I was never any good at it I never even managed to beat the easy route After several hours I still haven t but I m getting closer and already opened up more alternative paths than I ever did before I was worried it would look a little rough on my TV but I was wrong it looks fantastic I was hyped for Zero before but now my hype has gone through the roof Wait so this is only available in Europe?? In the words of Slippy Toad: \" NOOOOOOOOO!!!\" I checked the other day and it only showed Starfox Command so yeah it s not in NA yet wth why EU only??? Give NA it too!!! Zero is still not as good as 64 but I wish they will release it for Switch Remember getting it on import back in the day cost around £100 with the adapter…still an amazing game I loved the original but could never get into this one and I tried multiple times Have you tried the 3DS version? It s excellent! I still love to revisit this game years later It s one of the four N64 cartridges I own Star fox 64 is the best game on the n64 with banjo a close second Great great game Loved the 3DS one too Amazing amazing game both this and the 3DS version Still haven t played it on Switch I m on my first ever play of Sin &amp; Punishment But then I ll play this one for sure I prefer the prettier 3DS version with stereoscopic 3D but yeah this game has held up incredibly well over the years Still a blast to play today The 3DS version is amazing I remember getting this when it came out in 1997 bundled with the all-new Rumble Pak - I was 13 at the time I ll admit I definitely had a blast with it It was very impressive at the time I guess I wasn t crazy about the fact that you essentially had to play through the whole thing in one go not being able to save But the paths branching depending on how well you did in each level was cool I still remember trying and eventually succeeding in going through the most challenging route along the top of the map Ah better times I remember how awesome this was when I was a kid and how tedious I found it as an adult Lylat Wars was incredible I remember how disappointed I was to beat it in one sitting but I kept coming back to it and it turned out to be one of my favorite n64 games Loved this game but right from the start I was surprised by how much less impressive the music was compared to the SNES version SNES dedicated sound chip made it easier to make the music sound good I guess It was a SONY chip too which makes me wonder if the CD thing falling out also contributed to pulling a similar chip from the N64? Just idle speculation The only true achievement for SF64 is getting star fox into full 3D But aside from that it s just too plain and simple it doesn t add anything substiantially new to the existing formula SF2 and SF Zero on the other hand are much better designed games with some fresh ideas thrown into a regular SF routine But somehow SF64 is regarded as a pinnacle of the series while SF2 was instantly labeled as outdated and Zero straight up ignored by many solely because of control scheme One of the most perfect games ever made IMO Never was able to get all of the medals but this game is still probably in my top 5 ever It’s just so addicting I remember back at college there was at least one 2-week period where I was playing through this every day Fantastic game back in the day and still is!! Time for a new Star Fox!! Come on Nintendo get your arse in gear!! Cleared this game innumerable times It’s stellar The 3ds version is the best way to roll like a barrel Because Star Fox Zero is dog water If there s any game that screams \"Hey remember Star Fox 64? Well we sure do because it s the only game we ll keep on making due to it being the only one we see as profitable \" then it s that game no thanks in large part to the Star Fox 64 elitists who keep asking for the same thing never mind the fact that we could ve had better gameplay innovations with ideas from Star Fox Assault or Command but nope they had too throw out the baby with the bathwater and not think what would be a good idea and instead play it safe as usual Still playing this after 100 completions it’s still challenging and fun And I still struggle with the warp gates and I still get freaked out by brain Andross despite being in my mid 30s Whoa!!! Slippy might be a bit annoying but not enough to bring down the score a whole point 😂😂😂 I agree at least add Falco into the mix if you re going to dock a point for a character being annoying I remember playing this on Wii U VC and was entertained enough to keep playing but the game never saved seemed like Does this game even have save files? With suspend points this won’t be an issue now When i first played this i remember me and my dad had no idea how to get to the hard routes literally had to ask a guy in a game shop called 5th dimension how to do it Only then we realised you had to do 2 specific things in the first level to get the hard route Kind of a little cryptic but the game overall was very enjoyable If there s anything I d complain about is that I d now wish some of the bosses were more of a challenge Seems companies don t want to bring back what was enjoyed by many Still no new Pilotwings Desert Strike Road Rash ESPN Extreme Games Those are some of my favourites Assault is better imo Really wish Nintendo ran with some of the mechanics in that game That frog is part of the spirit of the game hahaha This game has perfect gameplay nothing to add or nothing to get away I played Assault on my Wii in 2013 and I have to say that I was not impressed Anyone else used to let Slippy die on purpose? I did almost every time After all this time Star Fox 64 is still the best Star Fox game Is slippy really that bad that he prevented the game from getting a perfect 10?!? 🤣🤣🤣 How dare you slander Slippy Toad Trying to remember but I think you started from the beginning each time you loaded it Replay came from mastering the levels and taking different paths to the end This game alone is the reason I still have my 64 It still holds up great and it s been baffling watching Nintendo bungle the series over the years As great of a game as Star Fox 64 is I really do wish people would stop comparing every other game in the series to 64 and expecting every game to be a clone of 64 Adventures was a pretty good game--even though it strayed from the formula in 64--with solid controls and more of an emphasis on story than a high score Assault was also pretty decent and had a lot of variety in gameplay and a multiplayer mode that kept you coming back for more But Command and Zero were the closest to 64 in terms of gameplay and they are the weakest entries in the series for their own reasons: For Command the map screen the time limits having to constantly protect the Great Fox II the branching story paths and multiple endings etc For Zero the mandatory second screen and gyro controls and the fact that it was essentially a reboot of 64 which was itself a reboot of the original SNES game So if anything the games that didn t follow the formula from 64 are the better games in the series while those that largely stuck to the formula sucked God I hate the Slippy hate! Is he one of my favorites? No But I do like him and feel the hate is completely undeserved I made models of the characters from this game specifically that s how much I love it I even do impressions The passion I have for this game alone is no joke Love the dialogue in this MY MASTER I VE FAILED YOUUUUUUUUU!

For as much as I love I’ve spent very little time with its multiplayer Believe it or not 1997’s did not have online support so I had to find opponents in my local area Unfortunately my ability to do that was incredibly limited I don’t think that I’ve played more than a match or two of the N64 original’s multiplayer but I did sneak in a bit more of ‘s competitive mode Since that remake didn’t have online play either it was again an uphill battle to find rival pilots But the accessibility of 3DS Download Play made this easier I distinctly remember spending an afternoon playing the mode with my Nintendo-loving aunt one summer However that wasn’t nearly enough for me to get my fill the success of switch online As you can tell the multiplayer element of largely passed me by For as much as I love its single player and for as often as I replay this game there is an entire facet of the experience that I have never been able to really enjoy That’s a damn shame Soon I’ll be able to rectify that on Switch After all Nintendo Switch Online titles are retrofitted with online multiplayer However I haven’t used this feature too often up to this point My friend and I spent some time getting disoriented by ’s pseudo-3D visuals and I’ve played some pass-the-controller SNES’ but that’s about it Online multiplayer in NES and SNES games largely felt like a nice gimmick but not an essential feature That’s all about to change with the introduction of Nintendo 64 games onto the service Having the likes of and among many others revitalized with online support will be a true revelation The very thing that made N64 so endearing in the face of PlayStation 1’s overwhelming success was its multiplayer emphasis Nintendo 64 was the party system With four controller ports on the front of the machine and a litany of wonderful multiplayer titles the N64 carved out its place in the market due to this focus But that is an appeal which has largely been lost to time unfortunately   We’ve haven’t been given the opportunity to recapture this 90s magic in the online era as playing N64 games nowadays has largely become an isolating experience On a personal level part of that can be attributed to those around me not wanting to play these decades-old games which is their loss! The larger part can be chalked up to Nintendo’s philosophy toward multiplayer Nintendo has maintained their reputation as the king of couch competition offering a constant reminder that local gameplay just can’t be beaten From to to local multiplayer has continued to be the lifeblood of the company’s stable of titles However they have been rightfully criticized for not at least offering the online option to those who need it We can’t all have the luxury of setting up local multiplayer matches with our loved ones I know this all too well considering that I go to college four hours away from home considering that many of my best friends attend another school states away and considering that my girlfriend and I are long-distance for good portions of the year Online play is vital in my life the magic of multiplayer Luckily Nintendo has improved on this front Now in the era of and your local-only and are the outliers But this new philosophy never worked backward The entirety of Nintendo’s non-NSO back catalog multiplayer games remained locked to local only Neither Wii or Wii U Virtual Consoles introduced the sort of online functionality that makes NSO interesting This is a shame as losing the ability to recapture what made an entire library so special is a real bummer For a long time this was the tale of Nintendo 64 Whenever I hear people talk fondly about the system retrospectively they’re always opining about the time they spent trash-talking and playing or I’ve always wanted to understand and contextualize the N64 through this lens For ages though Nintendo never made that viable If I’m not playing these games with others then I’m not truly experiencing what made this multiplayer-centric machine so special And in our digital-centric culture online is essential in accomplishing that To that point you really can’t beat getting some friends together in the same room for some Nintendo multiplayer fun But that just isn’t always feasible especially today when so many of us connect digitally particularly during the pandemic Local multiplayer just doesn’t always align with where we are societally making this ideal mode of play decidedly impractical It’s doubly impractical for the likes of N64 games which require either expensive original hardware or specific controllers for Virtual Console re-releases For so long there were so many barriers between the greater Nintendo community and our ability to relive N64’s magic as it was intended in the way that it became so beloved Nintendo 64 on NSO will be the next best thing a modern analog to the console’s 90s appeal I’ve always loved this machine as a solo player It’s one of my top-three consoles of all time even based on my limited perspective Now I’ll finally be able to share that love with my friends online who are similarly interested in Nintendo’s history but unable to connect with me in person We’ll be able to at least understand the spirit of what made these multiplayer landmarks so special through modern avenues But from the most subjective standpoint I’m just over the moon to simply play online with people who are as excited about this game as I am When your favorite games are retro and static as most of mine are it’s hard to have truly new experiences with them You come to learn their ins and outs and then you just retread those That’s familiar and that’s fun when you love a game so strongly But when you get to play an old favorite through a new lens well that feeling is just damn unmatched I’ll see you all online!

level After each level the stages repeat with increased difficulty For example Donkey Kong begins to hurl barrels faster and sometimes diagonally and fireballs speed up The victory music alternates between levels 1 and 2 The fourth level consists of 5 stages with the final stage at 125 meters The 22nd level is colloquially known as the due to a programming error that kills Mario after a few seconds effectively ending the game However in the Japanese Version 1 the player can complete all the stages up to 100 meters 100 meters in level 22 is the true kill screen of this version is considered to be the earliest video game with a storyline that visually unfolds on screen The eponymous is the game s villain The hero is a carpenter originally unnamed in the Japanese arcade release later named Jumpman and then Mario Donkey Kong kidnaps Mario s girlfriend originally known as Lady and later renamed Pauline The player must take the role of Mario and rescue her This is the first occurrence of the scenario that provided the template for countless video games to come The game uses graphics and animation for characterization Donkey Kong smirks upon Mario s demise Pauline has a pink dress and long hair and a speech balloon crying \"HELP!\" Mario depicted in red overalls and a red cap is an character a type common in Japan Graphical limitations and the low pixel resolution of the small prompted his design A mustache implies a mouth a cap obviates the animation of hair and colored overalls distinguish his arm movements The artwork of the cabinets and promotional materials make these cartoon-like character designs even more explicit Pauline for example is depicted as disheveled like s in a torn dress and Like 1980 has but innovates by advancing a complete plot The game opens with the gorilla climbing a pair of ladders to the top of a construction site accompanied by a variation on the musical theme from He drops Pauline and stomps his feet warping the steel beams He moves to his final perch and sneers A melody plays and the level starts This brief animation sets the scene and adds background to the gameplay a first for video games At the stage a heart appears between Mario and Pauline but Donkey Kong grabs her and climbs higher causing the heart to break The narrative concludes when Mario reaches the end of the rivet stage He and Pauline are reunited and a short intermission plays was founded in 1980 with minor success at importing its parent s arcade cabinets from Japan In early 1981 its president bet the small startup company on a major order of 3 000 Its poor reception in America filled a warehouse with 2 000 unsold machines so Arakawa requested that the parent company president send a conversion kit of new game software Yamauchi polled the company s entire talent pool for fresh game design concepts to save the distressed startup This yielded s debut as lead game designer of his concept and Yamauchi appointed head engineer as project supervisor with a budget of equivalent to $760 000 in 2020 according to Miyamoto was subcontracted for some of the development with no role in the game s creation or concept but to provide \"mechanical programming assistance to fix the software created by Nintendo\" Nintendo instructed Ikegami to produce a program according to its instructions and put it onto ROM chips on PC boards This later led to mutual lawsuits in 1983 as Ikegami asserted ownership over which Nintendo denied as Ikegami was a subcontractor who had already been paid called it \"simply a nuisance tactic\" on the part of Ikegami At the time Nintendo was also pursuing a license to make a game based on the comic strip When this license attempt failed Nintendo took the opportunity to create new characters that could then be marketed and used in later games Miyamoto came up with many characters and plot concepts but he settled on a love triangle between a gorilla a plumber with a large hammer and a girlfriend that mirrors the rivalry between and Popeye for Bluto became an ape which Miyamoto said was \"nothing too evil or repulsive\" He would be the pet of the main character \"a funny hang-loose kind of guy \" Miyamoto has also named \" \" and the 1933 film as influences Although its origin as a comic strip license played a major part marked the first time that the storyline for a video game preceded the game s rather than simply being appended as an afterthought Unrelated games were eventually released by Nintendo for the the following month and for the in 1982 Yamauchi wanted primarily to target the North American market so he mandated that the game be given an English title as with many previous Nintendo games Miyamoto decided to name the game for the ape who he said was the strongest character The story of how Miyamoto came up with the name \"Donkey Kong\" varies A false urban myth says that the name was originally meant to be \"Monkey Kong\" but was misspelled or misinterpreted due to a blurred fax or bad telephone connection Another more credible story claims Miyamoto looked in a Japanese-English dictionary for something that would mean \"stubborn gorilla\" or that \"Donkey\" was meant to convey \"silly\" or \"stubborn\"; \"Kong\" was common Japanese slang for \"gorilla\" A rival claim is that he worked with Nintendo s export manager to come up with the title and that \"Donkey\" was meant to represent \"stupid and goofy\" In 2001 Miyamoto stated that he thought the name would convey the thought of a \"stupid ape\" Miyamoto had high hopes for his new project He was not a programmer so instead consulted technicians for concept feasibility He wanted to make the characters different sizes and have different movements and reactions Yokoi thought Miyamoto s original design was too complex though he had some difficult suggestions such as using see-saws to catapult the hero across the screen which was eventually found too hard to program though a similar concept came later in the arcade game Miyamoto then thought of using sloped platforms barrels and ladders When he specified that the game would have multiple stages the four-man programming team complained that he was essentially asking them to implement the game repeatedly Nevertheless they followed Miyamoto s design creating a total of approximately 20  of content Yukio Kaneoka composed a simple soundtrack to serve as background music for the levels and story events The circuit board of was restructured for The hardware originally inspired by the hardware was designed for a large number of enemies moving around at high speeds which does not require so the development team removed unnecessary functions and reduced the scale of the circuit board The gameplay and graphics were reworked for updated chips and the existing sound hardware and monitor were left intact The character set scoreboard upper HUD display and font are almost identical to with palette differences The hardware has the memory capacity for displaying 128 foreground at 16x16 each and 256 background at 8x8 pixels each Mario and all moving objects use single sprites the taller Pauline uses two sprites and the larger Donkey Kong uses six sprites Hiroshi Yamauchi thought the game was going to sell well and phoned to inform Arakawa Nintendo of America s distributors Ron Judy and Al Stone brought Arakawa to a lawyer named to secure a trademark The game was sent to Nintendo of America for testing The sales manager disliked it for being too different from the and common at the time and Judy and Lincoln expressed reservations over the strange title Still Arakawa adamantly believed that it would be a hit American staff began translating the storyline for the cabinet art and naming the characters They chose \"Pauline\" for the Lady after Polly James wife of Nintendo s warehouse manager Arakawa suggested that the name of \"Jumpman\" a name originally chosen for its similarity to the popular brands and be changed to \"Mario\" in likeness of the landlord of the original office space of Nintendo of America These character names were printed on the American cabinet art and used in promotional materials was ready for release Stone and Judy convinced the managers of two bars in Washington to set up machines The managers initially showed reluctance but when they saw sales of $30 a day—or 120 plays—for a solid week they requested more units In their Redmond headquarters a skeleton crew composed of Arakawa his wife Yoko James Judy Phillips and Stone gutted 2 000 surplus machines and applied the conversion kits imported from Japan consisting of power supplies and marquee graphics The game officially went on sale in July 1981 Actor Harris Shore created the first live-action Mario in the television advertisements for Coleco s tabletop and games Makers of were interested offered a considerable fee for all rights to but Nintendo declined after three days of internal discussion Rivals and approached Nintendo in Japan and the United States respectively In the end Yamauchi granted Coleco exclusive console and rights to because he believed that \"It [was] the hungriest company\" In addition Arakawa believed that as a more established company in the U S Coleco could better handle marketing In return Nintendo received an undisclosed lump sum plus $1 40 per game cartridge sold and $1 per tabletop unit On December 24 1981 Howard Lincoln drafted the contract He included language that Coleco would be held liable for anything on the game cartridge an unusual clause for a licensing agreement Arakawa signed the document the next day and on February 1 1982 Yamauchi persuaded the Coleco representative in Japan to sign without review by the company s lawyers Coleco did not offer the game cartridge stand-alone; instead it was bundled with the console which went on sale in August 1982 Six months later Coleco offered and versions as well Coleco s Atari 2600 port was programmed by Coleco s sales doubled to $500 million and its earnings quadrupled to $40 million Coleco also released stand-alone tabletop versions of along with and in 1982 Coleco also bundled a copy of with its Atari VCS clone the in 1983 Atari obtained the license for versions of and released it for the When Coleco unveiled the running a port of at the 1983 in Chicago Illinois Atari protested that it was in violation of the licensing agreement Yamauchi demanded that Coleco s president withdraw his Adam port Greenberg complied and the game was not published In 1983 Atari released several computer versions under the Atarisoft label All of the computer ports have the cement factory level and most of the console versions do not None of the home versions have all of the intermission animations from the arcade game Some have Donkey Kong on the left side of the screen in the barrel level as he is in the arcade game and others have him on the right side Miyamoto created a greatly simplified version for the multiscreen handheld device Other ports include the Intellivision Atari 8-bit family and Mini-Arcade versions Two separate ports were developed for the : the first was published by in 1983 and the second by in 1986 The game was ported by to Nintendo s Famicom console and released in Japan on July 15 1983 as one of the system s three the Famicom s lead architect

compilation In 2002 the NES version was rereleased for the a add-on Later in 2004 the NES version was released as a separate cartridge for the Game Boy Advance in the A complete remake of the original arcade game on the titled referred to as during development contains levels from both the original and arcades It starts with the same gameplay and four locations as the arcade game and then progresses to 97 additional puzzle-based levels It is the first game to have built-in enhancement for the system The conversion of contains one of the longest-undiscovered in a video game Programmer Landon Dyer s initials appear if the player dies under certain conditions and returns to the title screen This remained undiscovered for 26 years until Dyer revealed it on his blog stating \"there s an Easter egg but it s totally not worth it and I don t remember how to bring it up anyway \" The steps required to trigger it were later discovered by Don Hodges who used an emulator and a debugger to trace through the game s code Review scores Upon release in arcades compared it favorably with and predicted that it would likely become a success In his 1982 book Steve Bloom described as \"another bizarre cartoon game courtesy of Japan\" and said it was one of the \"most exciting variations\" on s along with s due to how players need to \"scale from the bottom of the screen to the top\" which make them \"more like obstacle courses than mazes\" since \"you always know where you re going — up \" In January 1983 the 1982 gave it the award for the best and the Certificate of Merit as runner-up for In September 1982 reviewed the ColecoVision port and scored it 9 out of 10 in 1983 stated that \"Coleco did a fabulous job\" with the best of the console s first five games and \"the most faithful adaptation of the original video game I have seen\" The magazine s stated that of Coleco s three console versions the one for the ColecoVision was the best \"followed surprisingly by the Atari and Intellivision in that order\" reviewed the ColecoVision port in its September 1984 issue and scored it 4 out of 4 in all four categories of Action Graphics Addiction and Theme Ed Driscoll reviewed the Atari VCS version of in No 59 Edwards commented that \"The faults really outweigh the plusses especially if you ve got Fever For the addicted your cure lies elsewhere Still if you just play the game occasionally or never you may like this cartridge However play the store s copy or try a friend s before you buy \" was very popular worldwide garnering a positive reaction from consumers and was a significant commercial success for Nintendo pulling them out of financial troubles After the game s initial 2 000 sold out more orders were made Arakawa began manufacturing the electronic components in Redmond because waiting for shipments from Japan was taking too long The game s success led to Arakawa expanding Nintendo of America By October was selling 4 000 units a month and by June 1982 Nintendo had sold 60 000 machines in the United States earning $180 million Judy and Stone who worked on straight commission became millionaires Arakawa used Nintendo s profits to buy 27 acres 11 ha of land in Redmond in July 1982 Nintendo earned another $100 million on the game in its second year of release in America totaling $280 million in US cabinet sales by 1982 equivalent to $800 000 000 in 2020 In Japan the annual charts listed as the highest-grossing and then the sixth highest-grossing arcade game of 1982 with later listing the game in its October 1 1983 issue as the twentieth most successful of the month In the United States topped the arcade charts in October 1981 setting a weekly earnings record and it was later listed by as the highest-grossing It was also among the thirteen highest-grossing in the United States According to in June 1983 the home versions contributed to the arcade version s extended popularity compared to the four to six months that the

suspected it might be a trademark infringement of Universal s own On April 27 1982 he met with Arnold Greenberg of Coleco and threatened to sue over Coleco s home version of Coleco agreed on May 3 1982 to pay to Universal of 3% of their s net sale price worth about $4 6 million Meanwhile Sheinberg revoked Tiger s license to make its game but O R Rissman refused to acknowledge Universal s claim to the trademark When Universal threatened Nintendo Howard Lincoln and Nintendo refused to cave In preparation for the court battle ahead Universal agreed to allow Tiger to continue producing its game as long as they distinguished it from Universal sued Nintendo on June 29 1982 and announced its license with Coleco The company sent letters to Nintendo s licensees all of which agreed to pay royalties to Universal except and was heard in the by Judge Robert W Sweet Over seven days Universal s counsel the New York firm Townley &amp; Updike argued that the names and were easily confused and that the plot of the game was an infringement on that of the films Nintendo s counsel countered that Universal had themselves argued in a previous case that s scenario and characters were in the Judge Sweet ruled in Nintendo s favor awarding the company Universal s profits from Tiger s game $56 689 41 damages and attorney s fees Universal appealed trying to prove consumer confusion by presenting the results of a telephone survey and examples from print media where people had allegedly assumed a connection between the two Kongs On October 4 1984 however the court upheld the previous verdict Nintendo and its licensees filed counterclaims against Universal On May 20 1985 Judge Sweet awarded Nintendo $1 8 million for legal fees lost revenues and other expenses However he denied Nintendo s claim of damages from those licensees who had paid royalties to both Nintendo and Universal Both parties appealed this judgment but the verdict was upheld on July 15 1986 Nintendo thanked John Kirby with the gift of a $30 000 sailboat named and \"exclusive worldwide rights to use the name for sailboats\" the titular protagonist of the series was named in John Kirby s honor The court battle also taught Nintendo they could compete with larger entertainment industry companies After the release of the arcade successor to Ikegami sued Nintendo for the unauthorized duplication of the program code Nintendo managed to settle the dispute out of court after the two companies came to an agreement At the time of the suit computer programs were not considered copyrightable material The Tokyo High Court gave a verdict in 1989 that acknowledged the originality of program code Ikegami and Nintendo reached a settlement the following year; the terms of it were never disclosed In 1996 listed the arcade Atari 7800 and cancelled Coleco Adam versions as number 50 on their \"Top 100 Games of All Time\" commenting that even ignoring its massive historical significance stands as a great game due to its demanding challenges and graphics which manage to elegantly delineate an entire scenario on a single screen In February 2006 rated it the 148th best game made on a Nintendo system Today is the fifth most popular arcade game among collectors spawned a number of other titles with a mix of running jumping and vertical traversal a novel genre that did not match the style of games that came before it The genre was initially referred to as \"Donkey Kong-type\" or \"Kong-style\" games before the genre eventually came to be known as platform games The game was also a milestone in terms of video game storytelling and While there were earlier games that either told a story or used cutscenes combined both concepts together to introduce its own new concept: using cutscenes to visually advance a complete story It also notably had multiple distinct that progressed the storyline was also one of the first Japanese games brought to Western regions that introduced a surreal concept using cute artwork a representation of typical Japanese fantasy but unusual to Western audiences For that reason and similar games that followed were briefly called \"novelty games\" by Western gaming press and other such novelty games helped to acclimate Western audiences to Japanese approaches to game design narrative and abstraction that would become key elements in the decade that followed with the release of the Famicom/Nintendo Entertainment System called \"the most momentous\" release of 1981 as it \"introduced three important names\" to the global video game industry: Nintendo Shigeru Miyamoto and Mario These three figures went on to play a significant role in video game history paved the way for the NES known as the Famicom in Japan Following the success of Nintendo began developing the Famicom the hardware of which was largely based on the arcade hardware with the goal of matching the system s powerful capabilities in a home system Nintendo wanted the Famicom to match the arcade hardware so they took a arcade cabinet to manufacturer for analysis which led to Ricoh producing the PPU chip for the NES The NES version was re-released as an unlockable game in for the It was also published on for the and The Wii U version is also the last game that was released to celebrate the 30-year anniversary of the Japanese version of the NES the Famicom The original arcade version of the game appears in the game and must be beaten to finish the game Nintendo released the NES version on the and for the in 2002 and 2004 respectively In 2004 Namco released an arcade

current Donkey Kong being Cranky s grandson and s son Contents Donkey Kong s character design was created by for the arcade game in which the big ape kidnaps s original girlfriend Miyamoto says that he chose the name \"Donkey\" to reflect the character s stupidity while \"Kong\" was considered a generic term for large apes in Japan Miyamoto was informed by of America staff that the word \"donkey\" is not a synonym for \"idiot\" in English despite what the dictionary he consulted said but decided to ignore this particular suggestion because he liked the name \"Donkey Kong\" However this is contradicted by the deposition he gave during s lawsuit against Nintendo He stated that his proposals for Kong s first name were rejected and that he was unaware of who came up with it Export manager Shinichi Todori s deposition revealed that he came up with the first name after trying to translate 「頓馬」 into English It was either or who gave the final approval for the name The states that Shigeru Miyamoto supposedly claimed that Donkey Kong s character was inspired by the fairy tale though no further source or statement is provided Donkey Kong s exact role in the is somewhat hazy His original appearance portrayed him as a villainous or confused ape with unequaled strength In these games Donkey Kong did not wear a tie The 1994 was the first game to feature the tie a red tie with

variety of objects at Mario although there are sometimes stage hazards Donkey Kong can utilize such as pressing a to make bridges appear and disappear Eventually he is cornered at the and falls off upon defeat; however he is then enlarged by several forcing Mario to fight the newly enlarged ape off by throwing barrels at his face Defeating Donkey Kong again causes him to shrink and fall onto

            "<description>The Tapper game screen features four bars. Patrons arrive periodically at the end of the bar opposite the player and demand drinks. The player must draw and serve drinks to the patrons as they slowly advance towards the player. If any customers reach the player's end of the bar, they impatiently grab the player-as-bartender and toss him out the far end of the bar, costing the player a life.[6]\n",
            "\n",
            "The player serves customers by filling a mug at one of the four taps. Once the mug is full, the player releases the tap which automatically slides the mug towards the advancing customer. Customers catch mugs that are slid towards them, as long as they are not already drinking a beer, or otherwise distracted. If a mug is not caught by a customer (whether the customer is already drinking or distracted, or if there is no customer), then it falls off the bar on the other end, resulting in a loss of a life for the player. If a customer does catch the mug, though, then he or she is pushed back some amount towards the opposite end of the screen. The goal is to push the customer completely off the screen, but if they are not then they will stay and consume their drink in place. When a customer finishes his drink, he slides the empty mug back towards the player, after which the customer resumes his advance on the player. The player must collect the empty mugs before they reach the end of the bar and fall to the ground, as a mug falling to the ground costs a life.\n",
            "\n",
            "Periodically, customers will leave tips on the bar for the player. These tips can be left at any place on the bar. The tip will appear after a specific number of empty mugs are released by the customers, and will appear wherever the customer who releases the required mug is standing. For example, in all levels, the first tip is left by the customer who returns the second empty mug, and will be left beside wherever this customer is standing. By collecting the tip, the player earns extra points and initiates \"entertainment\" for that level (dancing girls on the wild-west level, cheerleaders on the sports level, etc.). While the entertainment is active, some fraction of the customers will be distracted and stop advancing towards the player, but they will also stop catching mugs.\n",
            "\n",
            "To complete a level the player must clear the entire bar of customers. Once this is done, the player is presented with a short vignette in which the bartender draws a drink for himself, drinks it, then tosses the empty mug into the air with varying (usually humorous) results, such as kicking it and shattering it or having the mug fall atop his head and cover it.\n",
            "\n",
            "As the game progresses, the customers appear more frequently, move faster along the bar, and are pushed back shorter distances when they catch their drinks. In addition, the maximum number of customers per bar gradually increases until every bar can have up to four customers at a time.\n",
            "\n",
            "In between levels of different settings, the player is presented with a shell game-type round. In this segue, the player is presented with a single bar that has six cans of beer or root beer sitting on top of it. A masked villain shakes every can except one and then pounds on the bar, causing the cans to shuffle their positions. If any other shaken can is picked, it explodes in the bartender/soda jerk's face, after which the right can is revealed. If the player selects the unshaken can, the hero is shown smiling and a message reads \"This Bud's For You\" (on the Budweiser version) or \"This one's for you\" (on Root Beer Tapper), and the player is rewarded with extra points.\n",
            "\n",
            "There are four settings for the game, each setting lasting for two to four levels. The settings of the game are:\n",
            "\n",
            "-  A western bar with cowboys (2 levels)\n",
            "-  A sports bar with athletes (3 levels)\n",

            "-  A space bar with aliens (4 levels)\n",
            "\n",
            "After completing all the levels, 13 in all, the player starts at the first again, harder than the first time through, and with some minor variations.</description>\n",

a rather difficult breakup at the time and I think that had something to do with it \" he said Staten and Griesemer discussed seeing the war from the Covenant perspective forming the idea to have part of the game told from the perspective of a Covenant warrior known as the Dervish Late in development the Dervish became the Arbiter after legal teams at Microsoft were afraid the game was sending a message about Islam In February 2003 Bungie began developing a gameplay demonstration for 2003 The demo which was the first gameplay seen by the public showcased new enemies and abilities Many elements of the trailer however were not game-ready; the entire graphics engine used in the footage had to be discarded and the trailer s environment never appeared in the final game due to limitations on how big the game environments could be Elements like vehicle hijacking were entirely scripted and in order to keep performance at an acceptable level a Bungie staff member deleted objects from the game as the player passed through The restructuring of the engine meant that there was no playable build of for nearly a year and assets and environments produced by art and design teams could not be prototyped bottlenecking development Griesemer recalled that development was \"moving backwards\" and after E3 the team realized that much of what the team had worked on for the past two years would have to be scrapped In order to ship the game Bungie began paring back their ambitions for the single- and multiplayer parts of the game All other Bungie projects including were cancelled with their teams folded into to complete the game The campaign was completely rethought and remained unplayable for more than a year while the multiplayer was being developed Ultimately a third act of the game where Master Chief and Arbiter came together on Earth to defeat the Prophets was cut entirely Staten hoped the resulting cliffhanger would be treated like the end of Planned vehicles such as variants of the and an were scrapped With the single-player mode in trouble very little had been done with the large Warfare multiplayer mode Eventually the entire warfare mode was cut and Hoberman s small team project became the shipping multiplayer suite Engineer Chris Butcher commented \"For we had our sights set very high on networking Going from having no internet multiplayer to developing a completely new online model was a big challenge to tackle all at once and as a result we had to leave a lot of things undone in order to meet the ship date commitment that we made to our fans \" As one of Microsoft s tentpole games the publisher had two full-time user experience researchers managing a team of working on the title The researchers used playtests surveys and to provide Bungie with input on how the game would be received Feedback of the game s matchmaking system was very unfavorable with the testers preferring the control offered by traditional servers Researcher John Hopson recalled that while they suggested to Bungie they should change the matchmaking system the developers remained steadfast their new approach would be better in the real world; Hopson later agreed with their choice saying that his team had only narrowly avoided ruining the game To test real-world network conditions Bungie ran a closed alpha of the multiplayer with 1000 Microsoft employees for five weeks Outside of Bungie s success had become a problem for s development as the success of the Xbox platform was riding on Microsoft originally pressured Bungie to have the game ready as a launch title for Xbox Live in November 2002 which Bungie employees told them was impossible At one point Microsoft executives had a vote over whether to force Bungie to ship the incomplete game or give them another year of development time Microsoft Studios head walked out of the vote and threatened to resign to get Bungie the extra time Missing the Xbox s last holiday season before its successor console the shipped was not an option To hit its new November 9 2004 release date Bungie went into the \"mother of all \" in order to finish the game \"A lot of people sacrificed themselves in ways that you should never have to for your job \" design lead Paul Bertone recalled; he kenneled his dog for nearly two months and slept in the office for the final days of development Griesemer said that this lack of a \"polish\" period near the end of the development cycle was the main reason for s shortcomings Butcher retrospectively described s multiplayer mode as \"a pale shadow of what it could and should have been\" due to the tight schedule s soundtrack was composed primarily by and his musical partner the team that had composed the critically acclaimed music of O Donnell noted in composing the music for that \"making a sequel is never a simple proposition You want to make everything that was cool even better and leave out all the stuff that was weak \" O Donnell made sure that no part of the game would be completely silent noting \" is one of the main ways to immerse people psychologically A dark room is spooky but add a creaking floorboard and rats skittering in the walls and it becomes creepy \" unlike its predecessor was mixed to take full advantage of 5 1 Digital In the summer of 2004 producer and O Donnell decided to release the music from on two separate ; the first Volume One would contain all the themes present in the game as well as music \"inspired\" by the game; the second would contain the rest of the music from the game much of

musicians including Steve Vai and The CD containing the game music organized in form was released on April 25 2006 was officially announced in September 2002 with a cinematic trailer scheduled for a Holiday 2003 release The first major look at the game came with the E3 2003 demo in May; was Microsoft s strongest showing at the event and some journalists believed the game looked too good to be live gameplay and must have been a scripted cutscene After delays the game was shifted to a first-quarter 2004 release then to Holiday 2004 The final November 9 release date was confirmed at E3 2004 where the game s multiplayer was playable on the show floor Microsoft executive rolled up his sleeve to reveal the date tattooed on his bicep Microsoft intended to market not just as a video game but

in movie theaters making the first video game so advertised Hype for the title was fueled by the press with Microsoft telling one journalist that their review would be the most consequential of their career The marketing heavily focused on Master Chief and the defense of earth leaving the reveal of the Arbiter as a playable character a surprise s release was preceded with promotions and product

levels of which 14 are playable Halo 2 features a modified version of the engine from Halo: Combat Evolved This new engine featured support for online play via Xbox Live improved visuals and the implementation of the Havok physics engine that would replace Bungie s in house physics engine used in Combat Evolved Halo 2 was initially meant to implement a new graphics engine called Pstencil that would allow for objects to cast real-time shadows This lighting technique proved too expensive for the Xbox s hardware to handle and was only ever seen in the E3 2003 demo of Halo 2 In order to make the demo playable on stage massive optimization had to be done across the demo map such as the deletion of objects that were no longer in frame In the aftermath of the success of in the multiplayer and LAN scene there was a desire to double down on multiplayer development The team was also involved in the development of Xbox Live at this point One of the biggest alterations to gameplay in is perhaps the ability to weapons; this tactic allows for twice the firepower at the expense of being unable to throw grenades or without dropping the left weapon In terms of vehicles all vehicles from the first game remain except the M12A1 Warthog LAAV rocket warthog from the PC version and the dropship Also a few new vehicles are introduced In however the previously indestructible vehicles can now be destroyed and the player is able to \" \" an enemy vehicle by climbing on and knocking the driver out as well as planting to further damage the vehicle The same can be done by an enemy to the player when driving When playing as the Arbiter the player s flashlight is replaced with a rechargeable that lasts for ten seconds giving the player a preemptive advantage on unsuspecting enemies The player can have a variety of allies; if they are playing as the Master Chief they will be assisted by and occasionally However the Arbiter is joined by and other allowing for deeper insight into Covenant culture On the damage mechanics fall damage now has been reduced considerably The threshold minimum damage has been increased such as from 3 stories building height will not cause player any damage while on it gives the player some damage The most benefits come from splatter damage as a slight touch from the object now is no longer kill anyone instantly including player Except some who are designed to be invulnerable The player now needs more effort to score a splatter kill has been the only game in the series to have the most content either cut from the game entirely or redesigned completely as evidenced in many forms of media In the Essentials disc featuring the \"Director s Commentary\" of the cutscenes three separate levels were discussed as having been proposed but ultimately scrapped due to time constraints: and In the \"Making of \" documentary there was concept art seen regarding a level location although the design was later placed into s as the The former could have been a part of pre-production for Marty O Donnell was also quoted in a Episode 13 at 21:00 saying that all the actors had recorded the lines to the original ending and that it still exists today but he will never show it The was a character that was modeled and placed in the coding of the game but never had AI programmed or had been placed on any level similar to the in The head writer for was With the campaign Staten was interested in expanding the game s scope from solely the Master Chief and humanity fleshing out the antagonists through the perspective of the The core idea behind the Arbiter was to create a character who suffered the consequences of the Master Chief s victory in the first game According to Staten Bungie co-founder and the game s project lead was extremely passionate about including two particular scenes that were ultimately cut In one of these the Master Chief would be standing on an orbital above Earth and look down on the carnage inflicted by the Covenant saying \"Only blood will pay for this \" A similar scene occurs in the final game at the conclusion of \" \" but the quote is absent Jones also wanted to have play the role of an antagonist and have her betray the Master Chief strapping and bomb to his back and throwing him down a hole Staten was not fond of the idea and though great effort convinced Jones it would not work in the context of the story A key theme in the story s development was bringing the war to Earth According to Microsoft Halo Franchise Development Group employee who liaised with Bungie on the development of the story Bungie was initially skeptical that fans would recognize the during the level and questioned the in-universe purpose they served This was the last work Trautmann worked on before leaving development on the Halo franchise in November 9 2004 s audio and soundtrack were directed by s composer and served as the team s audio lead and sound designer respectively A total of 21 090 lines of dialogue was recorded Unlike its predecessor allowed players to compete with each other over the online service in addition to the originals support for split-screen and System Link multiplayer Xbox Live mode offered a unique approach to online gaming that is intended to alleviate some of the problems that have plagued online first-person shooters in the past Traditionally one player sets their computer or console up as a game server or host specifying the game type and map and configuring other settings The game software then used a service like Xbox Live or GameSpy to advertise the game to the world at large; other players choose which game to join based upon criteria such as the map and game options each host is offering as well as the times they are able to receive In Xbox Live players do not choose to host games and they do not get to specify individual maps and options to search for Instead players sign up for \"playlists\" that are geared to different of play For example the \"Rumble Pit\" playlist offers a variety of \"free-for-all\" game types primarily Slayer or variations there of; \"Team Skirmish\" offers a number of 4-on-4 team games which are primarily objective-based games like Capture the Flag; \"Big Team Battle Skirmish\" is similar to Team Skirmish but allows teams of up to 8 players Other playlists allow various things such as matches between different The Xbox Live servers create games automatically from the pool of players that have signed up for each playlist choosing a game type and map automatically and selecting one player to serve as the game s host Players can create small \"parties\" with their friends and enter games together as teammates or in Rumble Pit adversaries They can also play custom gametypes like regular multiplayer Unranked gametypes allow people on the same Xbox console without an Xbox Live account to play with them as \"guests\" If the Xbox console hosting the game drops out the Xbox Live service automatically selects a new host from among the remaining players so the game can continue Since launching in November 2004 the service has been very popular with gamers While some players resent the loss of individual control inherent in s approach to online gaming others feel it provides a significantly improved gaming experience compared to more traditional online first-person shooters Bungie s servers match players up by skill level which tends to eliminate the kind of severely imbalanced games that less-skilled players often consider unfair and not enjoyable The automatic host selection process also eliminates the ability of the host to exert outsize control over the parameters of the game players with accounts can log on to and obtain highly detailed statistics on their performance including level maps for several hundred of the player s most recent games that indicate graphically where and when the player scored a kill or was killed him or herself On April 15 2010 the multiplayer services along with all other original Xbox LIVE services were discontinued However some of s fans left their Xbox s running after April 15 Xbox LIVE did not boot the approximately 500 people who had signed into Xbox LIVE before the discontinuation of service on April 15 These players continued playing online amongst one another but no new players could sign on On April 30 2010 only 12 fans who had managed to keep their Xbox and Xbox LIVE connections stable remained logged into on Xbox Live Nicknamed the \"Noble 12\" they continued to play games among themselves In response Stephen Toulouse director of policy and enforcement for Xbox Live tweeted \"To those noble folk keeping halo2 alive: we see you and we salute you \" These hardcore fans were awarded keys because of their attempts to keep alive Over the next 9 days 10 of the 12 gamers would experience either Xbox malfunctions or Internet malfunctions Some were reported as logging off voluntarily to play the they received Only two people remained online in On May 10 2010 \"Agent Windex\" was quoted as saying \"I just got kicked off guys Good Job Apache you re the last one\" Later that day \"Apache N4SIR\" the very last person on was booted from Xbox LIVE This marked the end of on Xbox LIVE and the end of the original Xbox LIVE In 2002 Bungie released the first glimpse of in a pre-rendered CG trailer The

the side of the Elites The events of this demo were featured in the final version of Some of the events and dialog of this demo was changed to fit the finished storyline of the game such as the AA Gun becoming a Scarab Most of this now appears in the level; To help promote Microsoft established the Halo 2 Council an off-shoot of its celebrity \"Xbox Playaz Club\" It had seven members consisting of actors and ; of the ; and bands and Members of the Halo 2 Council received advanced copies of the game as well as an exclusive \"Halo 2 Pelican Case\" a portable Xbox contained in a personalized

sales In company with PlayStation 2 s hit of the year it was the most sought-after video game among critics and gamers in 2004 Three weeks prior to launch stores in the U S alone had pre-sold 1 5 million copies of the game to consumers When it launched for the Xbox on the 9th of November over 7000 video game toy and electronics stores in the U S opened at midnight to welcome fanatical fans instantly began to prosper One national retailer sold 8 500 copies of the game in just 11 minutes and another had sold 200 000 units by daybreak One single store sold 500 units in three hours 350 of them being sold between midnight and 1 a m Early on the launch day Microsoft expected to generate more money in 24 hours on store shelves than any game had done before Moore said “I m calling a $100 million day on today ” went on to be the success that Microsoft was anticipating selling approximately 2 4 million copies in North America in 24 hours generating $125 million The video game software retailer GameStop sold more than half a million copies in one day In Australia where more than 42 000 gamers had pre-ordered the game prior to its release shattered retail sales records by selling

critically acclaimed Xbox game right behind and the Triple Pack The games multiplayer was held to be one of the best of all time staying consistently number 1 the most played Xbox Live title from November 2004 up until November of 2006 when released Most critics noted that stuck with the formula that made its predecessor successful and was alternatively praised and faulted for this decision Edge noted in its review “It s fitting that we re able to steal a line from the script to sum everything up No spoilers here just an epitaph from the moment Cortana turns to Master Chief and says this: It’s not an original plan But we know it’ll work \" According to Xbox com the game has received more than 38 individual awards The game s campaign mode has received some criticism for being too short in addition to some dissatisfaction with the abrupt cliffhanger ending that sets up the sequel GameSpot noted that the story switching between the Covenant and Human factions made the plot more intricate but also distracted the player from Earth s survival and the main point of the game There is also some criticism of the game s on-the-fly streaming and level of detail adjustment which can sometimes result in textures loading erroneously and \"popping in\" when the camera changes in cutscenes Bungie has stated that this issue had been fixed for and the Windows Vista port In an interview with Edge magazine in January 2007 Jamie Greisemer one of s design leads said that the main reason for s shortcomings was a lack of \"polish\" period near the end of the development cycle Staff member Frank O’Connor admitted the cliffhanger ending was abrupt noting “we drove off Thelma &amp; Louise style \" Nonetheless in the interview Greisemer promised that they would make a more than worthy

IMDb com Inc Halo 2: Anniversary for PC Review PCMag Halo 2: Anniversary for PC Review A classic shooter revamped with modern touches The Bottom Line Halo 2 Anniversary is a blast to play but like the other games in The Master Chief Collection it has problems too The non-stop action is occasionally sidelined by bugs so patiently wait for fixes Pros Cons Halo: The Master Chief Collection is a nostalgic compilation featuring Microsoft s classic first-person shooter titles but the reworked games come bundled with a good share of controversy The previously released Halo: Reach and Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary had problems out the gate including audio bugs graphics issues and online connectivity problems that weakened the otherwise excellent games Halo 2: Anniversary is a better overall game than those titles but unsurprisingly it has several flaws too This updated Halo 2 is a great as it features fast-paced shooting action wonderfully overhauled graphics and the ability to dual-wield weapons but visual hitches multiplayer glitches and the occasionally wonky enemy AI sours the experience a bit Halo 2: Anniversary can be enjoyed as a part of the $39 99 Halo: Master Chief Collection or on its own for $9 99 It’s also one of the games available in Microsoft’s excellent service The Legend Continues Halo 2: Anniversary picks up where ends with Master Chief and the marines celebrating their victory only to have the alien Covenant crash the party with a small scale invasion This time around the story also follows a disgraced Elite alien who takes on the role of Arbiter to serve the Covenant elders as a covert assassin and lapdog as they search for Halos Master Chief and Arbiter have identical control schemes and weapons with the only exception being that Arbiter also has -style camouflage for discreetly navigating environments As a result Arbiter can speed through areas and avoid being targeted far more easily than Master Chief Guns Blazing Much like its predecessor Halo 2: Anniversary is a movement-heavy mission-based that takes you on an intergalactic quest to save the human race It also introduces several powerful new weapon and enemy types that aren t in Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary Similar Products Halo: Reach for PC Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary for PC Halo: Spartan Strike for Windows 8 Doom for PC Doom Eternal for PC The expanded weapon list includes weapons from Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary that only enemies wielded such as the powerful Energy Sword the laser-spewing Sentinel Beam the grenade-launching Brute Shot and the bullet-spraying Sub-Machine Gun Halo 2: Anniversary brings dual-wielding to the Master Chief Collection so one-handed firearms can be equipped on either arm effectively doubling your shooting power Needlers guns that launch explosive darts is my go-to weapon for mid-range engagements as they absolutely shred enemy shields They re great dual-wield weapons The downside is that you must drop a gun to toss a grenade or use a melee attack so you must be choosy about when to lob a bomb or throw elbows Halo 2: Anniversary also has thrilling vehicular combat You ll find military rovers alien hovercraft flying ships and tanks These vehicle sections spice up the gameplay so the pace stays brisk even when you aren’t staring down the barrel of a gun   Halo 2: Anniversary expands Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary s enemy framework by adding new foes and more variants into the mix Drones are insect-like aliens that fly around the area and cling to walls whenever they’re not shooting at you Brutes are ape-like bruisers that are just as likely to charge at you as they are to shoot you Many enemies come in colored tiers that determine their rank; these colors indicate how much abuse they can take and how hard they hit Just as important is their armament An Elite with an Energy Sword is useless at range but devastating in a melee Grunts are pretty easy to gun down but they can easily drop you in one hit if they bring a big gun to the party As such prioritizing targets is the key to success  Unfortunately on occasion enemies would idle about uselessly instead of shooting or pursuing Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary didn t suffer this issue Halo 2: Anniversary features online play including the classic arena-based player-versus-player modes that the original game popularized While these games are incredibly fun they suffer baffling bugs that can hamper your enjoyment The scoreboard can simply stop working and you can teleport projectiles across the map by shooting at the ground The latter is a big reason to avoid competitive multiplayer action at the time of this writing Another issue: At times the game occasionally froze These instances didn t last very long perhaps half a second I encountered this sparingly at first but the problem became much more prominent around the fourth mission and onward The Old and New As with the previously released Master Chief Collection games Halo 2: Anniversary lets you switch between the classic Xbox game and the updated Anniversary game on the fly This swaps character models environments and music letting you play with whatever aesthetic suits your fancy With that said Halo 2: Anniversary wonderfully updates the graphics without radically changing the art design quite unlike Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary That game s overhauled graphics had busy over-designed textures and tweaked colors that changed the world s look and feel This is not the case in Halo 2: Anniversary so the updated graphics are a faithful improvement over the original game s visuals The Anniversary graphics make great use of modern shadow and lighting techniques to breathe life into the world It should be noted however that much like Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary Halo 2: Anniversary has many graphical flaws when played in Classic mode including level of detail LOD issues and absent lighting so the game looks worse than the original Xbox version at times This is a known issue that the development team is aware of so we’ll just have to wait for a fix Interestingly the Anniversary graphics also come with new CG cutscenes for several story sequences which leads to some pacing issues when swapping between visual styles The Anniversary CG doesn’t sync with the Classic mode s in-engine cutscenes so you can find yourself at different points in a scene if you swap visuals Audio is another significant improvement in Halo 2: Anniversary The original game s soft music and tinny gunfire sounds are replaced by a music-forward soundtrack with fresh flourishes and weapons with beefy sound effects In fact I experimented with all of Halo 2’s weapons in no small part due to the sounds they made which is a testament to what good sound design can do for a shooter   Under the Hood Halo 2: Anniversary runs fairly well on mid-range hardware My Intel i5-4690/ Nvidia GeForce GTX 970-powered pushes polygons between 60 and 80 frames per second at 1080p resolution You can crank the frame rate up to 120fps if your computer can run it and the game does very well at these higher frame rates with one odd exception Hand animations such as reloading sword-swinging and grenade-lobbing are locked to 60fps so when you run the game at a refresh rate higher than 60 the animations look a bit choppy To play this game your PC needs at least an AMD Phenom II X4 960T or Intel i3550 with an AMD HD 6850 or Nvidia GTS 450 or better Halo 2: Anniversary features full controller support ultrawide monitor support 4K graphics Steam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards Much like Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary Halo 2: Anniversary allows two-player online co-op as well as online PvP action There is no local split-screen play and its anyone’s guess when developer 343 Industries adds it if ever You need to create an Xbox Live account if you don’t already own one but you don t need a paid subscription to play on PC Fantastic and Flawed Halo 2: Anniversary offers great bang for your buck but the game still needs improvement It runs well on mid-range hardware save for the inexplicable stuttering at times Multiplayer is loads of fun yet the bugs can ruin the experience at the same time As a stand-alone $10 game it s a fantastic value but it could be better than it is now If you’ve never played the game it’s well worth the buy But if you’re on the fence about Halo 2: Anniversary or the Halo: Master Chief Collection as a whole maybe wait a bit for the inevitable string of bug fixes that follow For more Steam game reviews and previews check out PCMag s   page Halo 2: Anniversary for PC Pros Cons The Bottom Line Halo 2 Anniversary is a blast to play but like the other games in The
