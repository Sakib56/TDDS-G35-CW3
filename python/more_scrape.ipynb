            " Tapper , also known as  Root Beer Tapper , is a 1983  arcade game  developed by  Marvin Glass and Associates  and released by  Bally Midway . [4] [5]   Tapper  puts the player in the shoes of a  bartender  who must serve eager, thirsty patrons (before their patience expires [6] ) while collecting empty mugs and  tips . It was distributed in Japan by  Sega  in 1984.\n",
            " Originally sponsored by  Anheuser-Busch , the arcade version features a Budweiser motif. [7]  It was intended to be sold to bars, with cabinets sporting a brass rail footrest and drink holders. Early machines had game controllers that were actual Budweiser beer tap handles, which were later replaced by smaller, plastic versions with the Budweiser logo on them. [8]  The re-themed  Root Beer Tapper  followed in 1984, which was developed specifically for arcades because the original version was construed as advertising alcohol to minors.\n",

            "   Root Beer Tapper  replaces the bartender with a  soda jerk  serving non-alcoholic root beer. \n",
            " The controls consist of a four-position joystick and a tap handle. The game screen features four bars, each with a keg at one end and a door at the other. Customers enter through the doors and slowly advance toward the kegs, demanding service. The player controls a bartender who must pour drinks and slide them down the bar for the customers to catch. Pushing the joystick up or down instantly moves the bartender to the keg at the next bar in the chosen direction, with the top and bottom of the screen wrapping around to one another, while pushing left or right causes him to run along the bar where he is stationed. When the tap handle is pulled down, the bartender instantly moves to the keg (if he is not already standing there) and fills a mug; releasing it causes him to slide the mug along the bar.\n",
            " Customers slide back toward the doors upon catching a full mug, and disappear through the doors if they are close enough. If not, they stop after a certain distance, consume the drink, and resume their advance while sliding the empty mug back toward the keg. Customers occasionally leave tips on the bar, which the player can pick up for bonus points. Collecting a tip causes a group of female dancers to appear for a few seconds, distracting a portion of the customers so that they will stop advancing. However, distracted customers cannot catch drinks, and any customers who are either drinking or being pushed back at the start of the dancers' show will never be distracted.\n",
            " One life is lost whenever any of the following occurs:\n",
            " \n",
            " The player fails to catch an empty mug before it falls off the keg end of a bar and breaks \n",
            " A full mug slides to the door end of a bar without being caught, where it falls and breaks \n",
            " Any customer reaches the keg end of a bar, whereupon they grab the bartender and slide him across the bar out the door \n",
            "   An upright cabinet \n",
            " Each screen is completed when the bar is completely emptied of customers. The bartender then pours/consumes a drink of his own with humorous results involving the empty mug, such as getting it stuck on his head or stubbing his toe when he tries to kick it. As the game progresses, the customers appear more frequently, move faster along the bar, and are pushed back shorter distances when they catch their drinks. In addition, the maximum number of customers per bar gradually increases until every bar can have up to four customers at a time.\n",
            " The player proceeds through four levels, each with its own theme and appropriately dressed customers, and must complete a set number of screens to advance from one level to the next. The levels are:\n",
            " \n",
            " A western saloon with  cowboys  (2 screens) \n",
            " A sports bar with  athletes  (3 screens) \n",

            " An outer-space bar with  aliens  (4 screens) \n",
            " A bonus round is played after the end of each level, in which six cans of beer (or root beer) are placed on the bar. A masked figure shakes five of the cans, then pounds the bar to shuffle them. Choosing the one unshaken can awards bonus points, while choosing any other results in the bartender being sprayed in the face; in the latter case, the unshaken can flashes briefly to indicate its position.\n",
            " After completing all four levels, the player returns to the start of the sequence and continues the game at a higher difficulty level. [9] [10] \n",

[11]  He used a  Synclavier II  synthesizer running with custom software written by Richard Ditton. The system interfaced directly to the arcade game system so sounds were true to the capabilities of the hardware.\n",

            " Halo 2  is a 2004  first-person shooter game  developed by  Bungie  and published by  Microsoft Game Studios  for the  Xbox  console.  Halo 2  is the second installment in the  Halo  franchise  and the sequel to 2001's critically acclaimed  Halo: Combat Evolved . The game features new weapons, enemies, and vehicles, and shipped with online multiplayer via Microsoft's  Xbox Live  service. In  Halo 2 s story mode, the player assumes the roles of the human  Master Chief  and, occasionally, an extra-terrestrial called the  Arbiter  in a 26th-century conflict between the  United Nations Space Command , the genocidal  Covenant , and the parasitic  Flood .\n",
            " After the success of  Halo: Combat Evolved , a sequel was expected and highly anticipated. Bungie found inspiration in plot points and gameplay elements that had been left out of their first game, including online multiplayer. A troubled development and time constraints forced cuts to the scope of the game, including the wholesale removal of a more ambitious multiplayer mode, and necessitated a  cliffhanger  ending to the game's campaign mode. Among  Halo 2 s marketing was an early  alternate reality game  called \" I Love Bees \" that involved players solving real-world puzzles. Bungie supported the game after release with new multiplayer maps and updates to address cheating and glitches. The game was followed by a sequel,  Halo 3 , in September 2007.\n",
            " Halo 2  was a commercial and critical success and is often listed as one of the  greatest video games of all time . The game became the most popular title on Xbox Live, holding that rank until the release of  Gears of War  for the  Xbox 360  nearly two years later.  Halo 2  is the best-selling first-generation Xbox game, with more than  8 million copies sold worldwide. The game received critical acclaim, with the multiplayer lauded; in comparison, the campaign and its cliffhanger ending was divisive. The game's online component was highly influential and cemented many features as standard in future games and online services, including matchmaking, lobbies, and  clans .  Halo 2 s marketing heralded the beginnings of video games as   blockbuster  media. A port of the game for  Windows Vista  was released in 2007, followed by a high-definition remake as part of  Halo: The Master Chief Collection  in 2014.\n",

            " Halo 2  is a  shooter game . Players primarily experience gameplay from a  first-person  perspective, with the viewpoint shifting to third-person for vehicle segments. [4]  Players use a combination of human and Covenant weaponry and vehicles to progress through the game's levels. Certain weapons can be  dual-wielded , allowing the player to trade accuracy, the use of  grenades , and melee attacks for raw firepower. [5]  The player can carry two weapons at a time (or three if dual-wielding, with one weapon remaining holstered), with each weapon having strengths in different combat situations. Most Covenant weapons, for example, eschew disposable ammo magazines for a contained battery, which cannot be replaced once depleted. However, these weapons overheat if fired continuously. [5]  Human weapons are less effective at penetrating shields and require reloading ammunition, but cannot overheat due to prolonged fire. Players can  hijack  enemy vehicles and quickly assume control of them. The player is equipped with a damage-absorbing shield that regenerates when not taking fire; their  health bar  is not visible. [5] \n",
            " The game's \"Campaign\" mode offers options for both  single-player  and cooperative  multiplayer  participation. In campaign mode, the player must complete a series of  levels  that encompass  Halo 2 's storyline. These levels alternate between the  Master Chief  and a  Covenant  Elite called  the Arbiter , who occupy diametrically opposed roles in the story's conflict. Aside from variations in storyline, the Arbiter differs from Master Chief only in that his armor lacks a flashlight; instead, it is equipped with a short duration rechargeable form of  active camouflage  that disappears when the player attacks or takes damage. [6]  There are four  difficulty levels  in campaign mode: Easy, Normal, Heroic, and Legendary. An increase in difficulty will result in an increase in the number, rank, health, damage, and accuracy of enemies; a reduction of duration and an increase in recharge time for the Arbiter's active camouflage; a decrease in the player's health and shields; and occasional changes in dialogue. Enemy and friendly artificial intelligence is dynamic, and replaying the same encounters repeatedly will demonstrate different behavior. [4] \n",

            " Like  Halo: Combat Evolved , the Xbox version of  Halo 2  features a multiplayer system that allows players to compete with each other in split-screen and system link modes; in addition, it added support for  online multiplayer  via  Xbox Live . [5]  The Xbox Live multiplayer and  downloadable content  features of the Xbox version of  Halo 2  were supported until the discontinuation of the service in April 2010, [7]  with the final multiplayer session concluding May 10, almost a month after the service was officially terminated.

            " Instead of implementing multiplayer by having players manually join lobbies, as was common in games at the time,  Halo 2  used  matchmaking . Players chose the general type of match they want to play, and the game selected the map and gametype and automatically found other players. [12]  This \" playlist \" system automated the process of finding matches to keep a steady flow of games available at all times, and combined a skill-ranking system on top. [13] \n",

            " Halo 2  takes place in the 26th century. Humans, under the auspices of the  United Nations Space Command  or UNSC, have developed  faster-than-light  slipspace travel and colonized numerous worlds. [5]  Human worlds come under attack by a collective of alien races known as the  Covenant . Declaring humanity an affront to their gods, the  Forerunners , the Covenant begin to obliterate the humans with their superior numbers and technology. After the human planet Reach is destroyed, a single ship,  The Pillar of Autumn , follows protocol and initiates a random slipspace jump to lead the Covenant away from Earth. The crew discovers a Forerunner  ringworld  called  Halo . Though the Covenant believe Halo's activation will lead to divine salvation, the humans discover that the rings are actually weapons, built to contain a terrifying parasite called the  Flood . The human supersoldier Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 and his  AI  companion  Cortana  learn from Halo's AI monitor,  343 Guilty Spark , that activation of the Halos will destroy all sentient life in the galaxy to prevent the Flood's spread. Instead of activating the ring, Master Chief and Cortana detonate the  Pillar of Autumn s engines, destroying the installation and preventing the escape of the Flood. Master Chief and Cortana race back to Earth to warn of an impending invasion by Covenant forces. [14] \n",

            " Halo 2  opens with the trial of a Covenant Elite commander aboard the Covenant's capital city-ship of  High Charity . For his failure to stop Halo's destruction, the Elite is stripped of his rank, branded a heretic, and tortured by  Tartarus , the Chieftain of the Covenant Brutes. Spared execution, the Covenant leadership—the  High Prophets Truth, Regret, and Mercy —give the Elite the chance to become an  Arbiter , a rank given to Elites in times of great crisis or turmoil. As the Arbiter, the Elite quells a rebellion and recovers 343 Guilty Spark.\n",
            " On Earth, Fleet Admiral Hood commends the Master Chief and Sergeant  Avery Johnson  for their  actions at the first Halo , with Commander  Miranda Keyes  accepting a medal on behalf of her deceased father, Captain  Jacob Keyes . A Covenant fleet suddenly appears near Earth. In the ensuing battle, a single ship carrying the Prophet of Regret slips through Earth's defenses and besieges the African city of New Mombasa. Master Chief assists in repelling the invasion. With his fleet destroyed, Regret makes a hasty slipspace jump, and Keyes, Johnson, Cortana, and the Master Chief follow aboard the UNSC ship  In Amber Clad . The crew discovers  another Halo installation ; realizing the danger the ring presents, Keyes sends Master Chief to kill Regret while she and Johnson search for the Index, Halo's activation key.\n",
            " Responding to Regret's distress call,  High Charity  and the Covenant fleet arrive at the Halo. After Master Chief kills Regret, the Covenant bombard his location; he falls into a lake, where he is dragged away by tentacles. Regret's death triggers discord among the races of the Covenant, as the Prophets give the Brutes the Elites' traditional role as their honor guard. The Arbiter subdues Johnson and Keyes and retrieves the Index. Tartarus appears and reveals that the Prophets have ordered the annihilation of the Elites, and sends the Arbiter falling down a deep chasm.\n",
            " The Arbiter meets the Master Chief in the bowels of the Halo, brought together by a Flood creature called the  Gravemind . The Gravemind reveals to the Arbiter that the Great Journey is a lie, and sends the two soldiers to different places to stop Halo's activation. The Master Chief is teleported to  High Charity  as the Covenant falls into civil war. The Flood-infested  In Amber Clad  crashes into the city, and Cortana realizes that the Gravemind used them as a distraction. As the parasite overruns the city, the Prophet of Mercy is consumed. As for Tartarus, the Prophet of Truth consigns him to Halo with Keyes, Johnson, and Guilty Spark to activate the ring. Master Chief follows Truth aboard a Forerunner ship leaving the city; Cortana remains behind to destroy  High Charity  and Halo if Tartarus succeeds in activating the ring.\n",
            " On the surface of Halo, the Arbiter joins forces with Johnson and confronts Tartarus in Halo's control room. When the Arbiter tries to convince Tartarus that the Prophets have betrayed them, Tartarus instead activates the ring, and a battle ensues. The Arbiter and Johnson kill Tartarus while Keyes removes the Index; the unexpected deactivation sets Halo and all the other rings on standby for remote activation from a place 343 Guilty Spark calls \"the Ark.\" Meanwhile, Truth's ship arrives at Earth, and Master Chief informs Admiral Hood that he is \"finishing this fight.\"\n",

            " Halo  had never been planned as a trilogy, but the critical and commercial success of  Combat Evolved —selling more than five million copies in three years [15] —made a sequel expected. [16]  Xbox general manager  J Allard  confirmed  Halo 2  was in production at  Electronic Entertainment Expo  2002, with a planned release in time for Holiday 2003. [17] \n",
            " Many at Bungie wanted to make a sequel, building on cut ideas from  Combat Evolved  with a more ambitious follow-up. [18]  The added publisher support for a sequel allowed greater leeway and the ability to return to more ambitious ideas lost during  Combat Evolved s development. [16]  Not satisfied with merely adding back cut content to the sequel, designer Jaime Griesemer recalled that the team \"tripled everything,\" rebuilding the  game engine , changing the  physics engine , and prototyping a system for stencil  shadow volumes . [18] [19]  The game's development would suffer from a lack of clear leadership. Early development discussions happened in small, unconnected teams that did not talk with each other. Bungie cofounder and project lead  Jason Jones , who had been exhausted shipping  Combat Evolved , similarly burned out during  Halo 2 s production. Jones left the project to work on another Bungie game,  Phoenix , leaving fewer people to work on  Halo 2 . The departure of Bungie's cofounder  Alex Seropian  in 2002 caused additional friction and politics in the workplace where Seropian had once mediated tensions. Writer  Joseph Staten  described the team's ambitions thusly: [18] \n",
            " \n",
            " Then we just plowed ahead, much like we'd done with  Halo , with one notable exception. We ordered ourselves a giant sandwich, took a bite but didn't realize exactly how big it was before we started in. And we did that across the board, technically, artistically, and story wise. But of course, we didn't figure that out until way too late. \n",
            " Griesemer put it more bluntly: \"What's the phrase? Putting ten pounds of crap into a five-pound bag? We really tried to cram it too full, and we paid the price.\" [18] \n",
            " An important feature for  Halo 2  was multiplayer using Xbox Live. Multiplayer in  Combat Evolved  was accomplished via  System Link  and had nearly been scrapped altogether in the rush to complete the game. [18] [15]  Most players never played large maps, while a subset greatly enjoyed 16-player action, connecting consoles together with network cables for group play. \"We looked at the small set of fans who were able to do this,\" said engineering lead Chris Butcher, \"and just how much they were enjoying themselves, and asked ourselves if we could bring that to everybody. That would be something really special, really unique.\" [16] [15]  Initially,  Combat Evolved s multiplayer was supposed to involve larger maps and player counts than what shipped, and members of the team wanted to resurrect those plans for  Halo 2 . The smaller multiplayer modes and local split-screen capabilities of the first game would have been removed. Designer  Max Hoberman  successfully argued against wholesale removal of a successful component from the previous game. He was put in charge of a small team to further develop the small-scale arena multiplayer, while the rest of the team developed a larger \"Warfare\" mode. [18]  Bungie promised in previews that the core of this multiplayer would be squad-based online battles between human Spartans and Covenant Elites, with players able to call in airstrikes. [20]  Hoberman's pitch for  Halo 2 s arena multiplayer was to bring the fun of couch multiplayer online. As Hoberman was not an excellent video game player, he wanted to make sure the game remained fun for even lower-skilled players, rather than catering to the very competitive ones. The system of playlist matchmaking and allowing friends to \"party up\" to play games together were crucial to creating a global community of players. [15] \n",
            " The story for  Halo 2  grew out of all the elements that were not seen in  Combat Evolved . Jason Jones organized his core ideas for the sequel's story and approached Staten for input. According to Staten, among the elements that did not make it to the finished game was a \"horrible scene of betrayal\" where Miranda Keyes straps a bomb to the Master Chief's back and throws him into a hole in revenge for her father's death; \"Jason was going through a rather difficult breakup at the time and I think that had something to do with it,\" he said. [21] [18]  Staten and Griesemer discussed seeing the war from the Covenant perspective, forming the idea to have part of the game told from the perspective of a Covenant warrior known as the Dervish. Late in development, the Dervish became the Arbiter, after legal teams at Microsoft were afraid the game was sending a message about Islam. [18] [22] \n",
            " In February 2003, Bungie began developing a gameplay demonstration for  E3  2003. The demo, which was the first gameplay seen by the public, showcased new enemies and abilities. Many elements of the trailer, however, were not game-ready; the entire graphics engine used in the footage had to be discarded, and the trailer's environment never appeared in the final game due to limitations on how big the game environments could be. [18]  Elements like vehicle hijacking were entirely scripted, and in order to keep performance at an acceptable level, a Bungie staff member deleted objects from the game as the player passed through. The restructuring of the engine meant that there was no playable build of  Halo 2  for nearly a year, and assets and environments produced by art and design teams could not be prototyped, bottlenecking development. [16]  Griesemer recalled that development was \"moving backwards\", and after E3 the team realized that much of what the team had worked on for the past two years would have to be scrapped. [18] \n",
            " In order to ship the game, Bungie began paring back their ambitions for the single- and multiplayer parts of the game. [16]  All other Bungie projects, including  Phoenix , were cancelled, with their teams folded into  Halo 2  to complete the game. The campaign was completely rethought and remained unplayable for more than a year while the multiplayer was being developed. Ultimately, a third act of the game where Master Chief and Arbiter came together on Earth to defeat the Prophets was cut entirely. Staten hoped the resulting cliffhanger would be treated like the end of  The Empire Strikes Back . [18] [23]  Planned vehicles, such as variants of the  Warthog  and an  all terrain vehicle , were scrapped. [20] \n",
            " With the single-player mode in trouble, very little had been done with the large Warfare multiplayer mode. Eventually, the entire warfare mode was cut, and Hoberman's small team project became the shipping multiplayer suite. [18]  Engineer Chris Butcher commented, \"For  Halo 2  we had our sights set very high on networking. Going from having no internet multiplayer to developing a completely new online model was a big challenge to tackle all at once, and as a result we had to leave a lot of things undone in order to meet the ship date commitment that we made to our fans.\" [24] \n",
            " As one of Microsoft's tentpole games, the publisher had two full-time user experience researchers managing a team of  game testers  working on the title. The researchers used playtests, surveys, and  usability testing  to provide Bungie with input on how the game would be received. Feedback of the game's matchmaking system was very unfavorable, with the testers preferring the control offered by traditional servers. Researcher John Hopson recalled that while they suggested to Bungie they should change the matchmaking system, the developers remained steadfast their new approach would be better in the real world; Hopson later agreed with their choice, saying that his team had only narrowly avoided ruining the game. [25]  To test real-world network conditions, Bungie ran a closed alpha of the multiplayer with 1000 Microsoft employees for five weeks. [26] \n",
            " Outside of Bungie,  Combat Evolved s success had become a problem for  Halo 2 s development, as the success of the Xbox platform was riding on  Halo . Microsoft originally pressured Bungie to have the game ready as a launch title for Xbox Live in November 2002, which Bungie employees told them was impossible. At one point, Microsoft executives had a vote over whether to force Bungie to ship the incomplete game, or give them another year of development time. Microsoft Studios head  Ed Fries  walked out of the vote and threatened to resign to get Bungie the extra time. [18] \n",
            " Missing the Xbox's last holiday season before its successor console, the  Xbox 360 , shipped was not an option. [16]  To hit its new November 9, 2004, release date, Bungie went into the \"mother of all  crunches \" in order to finish the game. [23]  \"A lot of people sacrificed themselves in ways that you should never have to for your job,\" design lead Paul Bertone recalled; he kenneled his dog for nearly two months and slept in the office for the final days of development. [18]  Griesemer said that this lack of a \"polish\" period near the end of the development cycle was the main reason for  Halo 2 s shortcomings. [27]  Butcher retrospectively described  Halo 2 s multiplayer mode as \"a pale shadow of what it could and should have been\" due to the tight schedule. [27] \n",

            " Main article:  Halo 2 Original Soundtrack \n",
            " Halo 2 s soundtrack was composed primarily by  Martin O'Donnell  and his musical partner  Michael Salvatori , the team that had composed the critically acclaimed music of  Halo . O'Donnell noted in composing the music for  Halo 2  that \"making a sequel is never a simple proposition. You want to make everything that was cool even better, and leave out all the stuff that was weak.\" [28]  O'Donnell made sure that no part of the game would be completely silent, noting \" Ambient sound  is one of the main ways to immerse people psychologically. A dark room is spooky, but add a creaking floorboard and rats skittering in the walls and it becomes  really  creepy.\" [28]   Halo 2 , unlike its predecessor, was mixed to take full advantage of  Dolby  5.1 Digital  surround sound . [29] \n",
            " In the summer of 2004, producer  Nile Rodgers  and O'Donnell decided to release the music from  Halo 2  on two separate  CDs ; the first (Volume One) would contain all the themes present in the game as well as music \"inspired\" by the game; the second would contain the rest of the music from the game, much of which was incomplete, as the first CD was shipped before the game was released. [30]  The first CD was released on November 9, 2004, and featured guitar backing by  Steve Vai . Additional tracks included various outside musicians, including Steve Vai,  Incubus ,  Breaking Benjamin , and  Hoobastank . The  Halo 2 Original Soundtrack: Volume Two  CD, containing the game music organized in  suite  form, was released on April 25, 2006. [31] [32] \n",

            " Halo 2  was officially announced in September 2002 with a cinematic trailer, [16]  scheduled for a Holiday 2003 release. The first major look at the game came with the E3 2003 demo in May;  Halo 2  was Microsoft's strongest showing at the event, and some journalists believed the game looked too good to be live gameplay and must have been a scripted cutscene. [33]  After delays, the game was shifted to a first-quarter 2004 release, then to Holiday 2004. [34] [35]  The final November 9 release date was confirmed at E3 2004, where the game's multiplayer was playable on the show floor. [36]  Microsoft executive  Peter Moore  rolled up his sleeve to reveal the date tattooed on his bicep. [37] [38] \n",
            " Microsoft intended to market  Halo 2  not just as a video game, but as a cultural event. Part of its widespread appeal would come from the social nature of the game's multiplayer, but Microsoft also heavily promoted and marketed the game. A trailer for the game was shown in movie theaters, making  Halo 2  the first video game so advertised. [15]  Hype for the title was fueled by the press, with Microsoft telling one journalist that their  Halo 2  review would be the most consequential of their career. [39]  The marketing heavily focused on Master Chief and the defense of earth, leaving the reveal of the Arbiter as a playable character a surprise. [40] \n",
            " Halo 2   s release was preceded with promotions and product tie-ins. There was a  Halo 2  Celebrity Pre-Release Party at E3 2004, in which a private home was transformed to replicate the world of  Halo , complete with camouflaged Marines and roaming Cortanas. [41]  Launch events were held worldwide, with players waiting for hours in a line that stretched two blocks in  Times Square ,  New York City . [42]  The French version of the game  leaked  on the internet in October, and circulated widely. [43] \n",
            " In addition to more traditional forms of promotion,  Halo 2  was also part of an elaborate  Alternate Reality Game  project titled  I Love Bees . Microsoft approached 42 Entertainment's Elan Lee, who had helped launch the Xbox with Microsoft, on producing a tie-in game. [15]   I Love Bees  cost an estimated one million dollars. The game centered on a hacked  website , supposedly a site about  beekeeping , where an AI from the future was residing. The project garnered significant attention, drawing attention away from the ongoing  2004 Presidential Election . [44] [45]  The game won an award for creativity at the 5th annual  Game Developers Choice Awards [46]  and was nominated for a  Webby  award.

The war with the Covenant forces is still not going well, despite the destruction of an entire fleet at Halo, but the Master Chief needs a refit. Armed with the Mjolnir Armor Mark VI, he is on his way to a decorations ceremony with the thought-to-be-dead Sergeant Johnson, when Covenant forces emerge from the Slipstream into Earth space. But something is wrong: the fleet is much smaller than the one used to destroy Reach, humanity's former frontline stronghold. The Master Chief and Cortana, along with Commander Miranda Keyes and the crew of In Amber Clad, must fight off the Covenant and protect Earth, a battle that will take them across the galaxy to a new planet, which is disturbingly familiar...Meanwhile, the Prophets, leaders of the Covenant, are not pleased with the Elite Commander that allowed the Master Chief to destroy Halo, and he is branded a heretic. But even Heretics have their uses. He is to become the new Arbiter, a warrior for the Prophets' will, destined to die in glorious battle like all the other Arbiters before him. But deep in the Covenant, rumors are spreading about a Jiralhanae take-over. Can the Arbiter uncover this treachery in time to save the Elites?

            "Gravemind. Connections Edited into  Red vs. Blue  (2003) Soundtracks Breaking Benjamin Benjamin Burnley User reviews Review Top review   Halo is probably one of the hardest games in history to follow-up. But alas, after three years of waiting, the fans are finally served a huge amount of 'Flippin sweet' in this incredible masterpiece that shouldn't be even considered a game. Halo 2 creates a genre of its own. It's still a first person shooter, but there are so many things about this game that put it into this 'own genre' I like to call: Impossibly good. Its so awesome that it is nearly inevitable to play for hours on end just to beat your friend down for that one-millionth time in a multiplayer game. So what if the ending is a huge cliffhanger? The games story is so excellent and mezmorizing, its easy to forget about it. Awesome doesn't even kiss the feet of Halo 2. winged_loner Jun 5, 2006 Details Release date November 9, 2004 (United States) United States Bungie Software Products Corporation Official site English Chicago Illinois, USA Production companies Bungie Software Ministry of Motion (MOM) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Color Dolby Digital Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in February See the full list New Sci-Fi Movies and Shows to Watch in 2022 Watch the video Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-   2022    by IMDb.com, Inc. \n",

            " Halo: The Master Chief Collection is a nostalgic compilation featuring Microsoft's classic first-person shooter titles, but the reworked games come bundled with a good share of controversy. The previously released Halo: Reach and Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary had problems out the gate, including audio bugs, graphics issues, and online connectivity problems that weakened the otherwise excellent games. Halo 2: Anniversary is a better overall game than those titles, but unsurprisingly, it has several flaws, too. This updated Halo 2 is a great  PC game , as it features fast-paced shooting action, wonderfully overhauled graphics, and the ability to dual-wield weapons, but visual hitches, multiplayer glitches, and the occasionally wonky enemy AI sours the experience a bit. Halo 2: Anniversary can be enjoyed as a part of the $39.99 Halo: Master Chief Collection or on its own for $9.99. It’s also one of the games available in Microsoft’s excellent  Xbox Game Pass for PC  service. \n",

            " The Legend Continues Halo 2: Anniversary picks up where  Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary  ends, with Master Chief and the marines celebrating their victory, only to have the alien Covenant crash the party with a small scale invasion. This time around, the story also follows a disgraced Elite alien, who takes on the role of Arbiter to serve the Covenant elders as a covert assassin and lapdog as they search for Halos. Master Chief and Arbiter have identical control schemes and weapons, with the only exception being that Arbiter also has  -style camouflage for discreetly navigating environments. As a result, Arbiter can speed through areas and avoid being targeted far more easily than Master Chief. Guns Blazing Much like its predecessor, Halo 2: Anniversary is a movement-heavy, mission-based  shooter  that takes you on an intergalactic quest to save the human race. It also introduces several powerful new weapon and enemy types that aren't in Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary. \n",

            " The expanded weapon list includes weapons from Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary that only enemies wielded, such as the powerful Energy Sword, the laser-spewing Sentinel Beam, the grenade-launching Brute Shot, and the bullet-spraying Sub-Machine Gun. Halo 2: Anniversary brings dual-wielding to the Master Chief Collection, so one-handed firearms can be equipped on either arm, effectively doubling your shooting power. Needlers, guns that launch explosive darts, is my go-to weapon for mid-range engagements, as they absolutely shred enemy shields. They're great dual-wield weapons. The downside is that you must drop a gun to toss a grenade or use a melee attack, so you must be choosy about when to lob a bomb or throw elbows. Halo 2: Anniversary also has thrilling vehicular combat. You'll find military rovers, alien hovercraft, flying ships, and tanks. These vehicle sections spice up the gameplay, so the pace stays brisk even when you aren’t staring down the barrel of a gun.  Halo 2: Anniversary expands Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary's enemy framework by adding new foes and more variants into the mix. Drones are insect-like aliens that fly around the area and cling to walls whenever they’re not shooting at you. Brutes are ape-like bruisers that are just as likely to charge at you as they are to shoot you. Many enemies come in colored tiers that determine their rank; these colors indicate how much abuse they can take and how hard they hit. Just as important is their armament. An Elite with an Energy Sword is useless at range, but devastating in a melee. Grunts are pretty easy to gun down, but they can easily drop you in one hit if they bring a big gun to the party. As such, prioritizing targets is the key to success. Unfortunately, on occasion, enemies would idle about uselessly instead of shooting or pursuing. Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary didn't suffer this issue. Halo 2: Anniversary features online play, including the classic, arena-based player-versus-player modes that the original game popularized. While these games are incredibly fun, they suffer baffling bugs that can hamper your enjoyment. The scoreboard can simply stop working, and you can teleport projectiles across the map by shooting at the ground. The latter is a big reason to avoid competitive multiplayer action at the time of this writing.  Another issue: At times the game occasionally froze. These instances didn't last very long, perhaps half a second. I encountered this sparingly at first, but the problem became much more prominent around the fourth mission and onward.  \n",

            " The Old and New As with the previously released Master Chief Collection games, Halo 2: Anniversary lets you switch between the classic Xbox game and the updated Anniversary game on the fly. This swaps character models, environments, and music, letting you play with whatever aesthetic suits your fancy.  With that said, Halo 2: Anniversary wonderfully updates the graphics without radically changing the art design, quite unlike Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary. That game's overhauled graphics had busy, over-designed textures and tweaked colors that changed the world's look and feel. This is not the case in Halo 2: Anniversary, so the updated graphics are a faithful improvement over the original game's visuals. The Anniversary graphics make great use of modern shadow and lighting techniques to breathe life into the world. It should be noted, however, that much like Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2: Anniversary has many graphical flaws when played in Classic mode, including level of detail (LOD) issues and absent lighting, so the game looks worse than the original Xbox version, at times. This is a known issue that the development team is aware of, so we’ll just have to wait for a fix. Interestingly, the Anniversary graphics also come with new CG cutscenes for several story sequences, which leads to some pacing issues when swapping between visual styles. The Anniversary CG doesn’t sync with the Classic mode's in-engine cutscenes, so you can find yourself at different points in a scene if you swap visuals.  Audio is another significant improvement in Halo 2: Anniversary. The original game's soft music and tinny gunfire sounds are replaced by a music-forward soundtrack with fresh flourishes and weapons with beefy sound effects. In fact, I experimented with all of Halo 2’s weapons in no small part due to the sounds they made, which is a testament to what good sound design can do for a shooter.  Under the Hood Halo 2: Anniversary runs fairly well on mid-range hardware. My Intel i5-4690/ Nvidia GeForce GTX 970-powered  desktop gaming computer  pushes polygons between 60 and 80 frames per second at 1080p resolution. You can crank the frame rate up to 120fps if your computer can run it, and the game does very well at these higher frame rates, with one odd exception. Hand animations, such as reloading, sword-swinging, and grenade-lobbing, are locked to 60fps, so when you run the game at a refresh rate higher than 60, the animations look a bit choppy.  To play this game, your PC needs at least an AMD Phenom II X4 960T or Intel i3550  CPU , with an AMD HD 6850 or Nvidia GTS 450  graphics card  or better. Halo 2: Anniversary features full controller support, ultrawide monitor support, 4K graphics, Steam Achievements, and Steam Trading Cards. Much like Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2: Anniversary allows two-player online co-op as well as online PvP action. There is no local split-screen play, and its anyone’s guess when developer 343 Industries adds it, if ever. You need to create an Xbox Live account if you don’t already own one, but you don't need a paid subscription to play on PC. \n",

            " Fantastic and Flawed Halo 2: Anniversary offers great bang for your buck, but the game still needs improvement. It runs well on mid-range hardware save for the inexplicable stuttering at times. Multiplayer is loads of fun, yet the bugs can ruin the experience at the same time. As a stand-alone $10 game, it's a fantastic value, but it could be better than it is now. If you’ve never played the game, it’s well worth the buy. But if you’re on the fence about Halo 2: Anniversary, or the Halo: Master Chief Collection as a whole, maybe wait a bit for the inevitable string of bug fixes that follow.

Even those who just come for the shooting will likely be engrossed with what's happening in the plot. Of course, Halo 2's emphasis is still on shooting action, and it delivers that.\n",
