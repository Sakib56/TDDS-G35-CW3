## Scraping
<ol>
  <li>spider.py: File containing the code for the web crawler</li>
  <li>test.txt: File containing all the urls to look at (not sure I've covered everything)</li>
</ol>
<h3> How to run the scraper</h3>
<p>To run the scraper make sure you first install scrapy on your machine by doing
`pip install scrapy` 
Then go to the right directory and run
```scrapy runspider spider.py``` to run the spider, add -o file_name.json to save the output to a json file.</p>
